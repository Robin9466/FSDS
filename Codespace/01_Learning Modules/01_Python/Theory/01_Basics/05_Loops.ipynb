What are Loops?**\n","- **Loops** are like **repeating a task**. Imagine you're baking cookies: you mix the dough, scoop it onto a tray, and place it in the oven. If you have multiple trays to bake, you’d repeat the same steps for each tray until all the cookies are done. In programming, loops allow repeated execution of a block of code until a specified condition is met.\n","- Python supports two main types of loops:\n","  1. **`for` loop**\n","  2. **`while` loop**\n","\n","---\n","\n","## **2. `for` Loop**\n","\n","### **What is a `for` Loop?**\n","- The `for` loop iterates over a **collection** (like a list, tuple, or string) and executes the code for each item.\n","- **Analogy**: Think of it like going through a stack of books. You read each book one by one until you reach the end.\n","\n","#### **Syntax:**\n","```python\n","for variable in sequence:\n","    # Code block\n","```\n","\n","#### **Example:**\n","```python\n","fruits = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]\n","for fruit in fruits:\n","    print(fruit)\n","```\n","- **Output**:\n","  ```\n","  apple\n","  banana\n","  cherry\n","  ```\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **Using `range()` in `for` Loop**\n","- **`range()`** generates a sequence of numbers, often used with `for` loops.\n","- **Analogy**: If you were counting down the days until your birthday, you'd count from the current day to your birthday day.\n","\n","#### **Example:**\n","```python\n","for i in range(5):\n","    print(i)\n","```\n","- **Output**:\n","  ```\n","  0\n","  1\n","  2\n","  3\n","  4\n","  ```\n","\n","#### **Visualizing `range()`**:\n","\n","| `range()`        | Output           | Real-world Example                       |\n","|------------------|------------------|-----------------------------------------|\n","| `range(5)`       | 0, 1, 2, 3, 4    | Counting items in a box (5 items total)|\n","| `range(1, 5)`    | 1, 2, 3, 4       | Days of the week (Monday to Thursday)  |\n","| `range(1, 10, 2)`| 1, 3, 5, 7, 9    | Odd-numbered chairs in a row           |\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **Nested `for` Loops**\n","- Loops inside loops are called **nested loops**.\n","- **Analogy**: Think of a multi-layered cake. You can go through each layer and each piece of the cake.\n","\n","#### **Example:**\n","```python\n","for i in range(3):\n","    for j in range(2):\n","        print(f\"Layer {i}, Piece {j}\")\n","```\n","\n","- **Output**:\n","  ```\n","  Layer 0, Piece 0\n","  Layer 0, Piece 1\n","  Layer 1, Piece 0\n","  Layer 1, Piece 1\n","  Layer 2, Piece 0\n","  Layer 2, Piece 1\n","  ```\n","\n","---\n","\n","## **3. `while` Loop**\n","\n","### **What is a `while` Loop?**\n","- The **`while` loop** executes as long as a specified condition is `True`.\n","- **Analogy**: Imagine you’re filling a glass with water. You keep pouring until the glass is full. As long as the glass isn’t full (condition is `True`), you keep pouring.\n","\n","#### **Syntax:**\n","```python\n","while condition:\n","    # Code block\n","```\n","\n","#### **Example:**\n","```python\n","count = 0\n","while count < 5:\n","    print(count)\n","    count += 1\n","```\n","\n","- **Output**:\n","  ```\n","  0\n","  1\n","  2\n","  3\n","  4\n","  ```\n","\n","### **Infinite Loop**\n","- A loop that never stops is called an **infinite loop**.\n","- **Analogy**: It’s like a hamster running in a wheel; it keeps going without an end unless interrupted.\n","\n","#### **Example (avoid using it):**\n","```python\n","while True:\n","    print(\"This is an infinite loop\")\n","```\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **Using `break` and `continue`**\n","\n","1. **`break`**: Terminates the loop entirely when a condition is met.\n","   - **Analogy**: Imagine you're at a traffic light. When it turns red, you stop (break) your movement.\n","\n","   #### **Example:**\n","   ```python\n","   for i in range(10):\n","       if i == 5:\n","           break\n","       print(i)\n","   ```\n","   - **Output**:\n","     ```\n","     0\n","     1\n","     2\n","     3\n","     4\n","     ```\n","\n","2. **`continue`**: Skips the current iteration and moves to the next.\n","   - **Analogy**: Like skipping a bad song on your playlist; you just move to the next one without stopping the music.\n","\n","   #### **Example:**\n","   ```python\n","   for i in range(5):\n","       if i == 2:\n","           continue\n","       print(i)\n","   ```\n","   - **Output**:\n","     ```\n","     0\n","     1\n","     3\n","     4\n","     ```\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **Nested `while` Loops**\n","- Just like `for` loops, **`while` loops** can be nested.\n","- **Analogy**: Think of a vending machine where you can press multiple buttons for different snacks. You press one button (outer loop), then choose a snack (inner loop).\n","\n","#### **Example:**\n","```python\n","i = 1\n","while i <= 3:\n","    j = 1\n","    while j <= 2:\n","        print(f\"Outer loop {i}, Inner loop {j}\")\n","        j += 1\n","    i += 1\n","```\n","\n","- **Output**:\n","  ```\n","  Outer loop 1, Inner loop 1\n","  Outer loop 1, Inner loop 2\n","  Outer loop 2, Inner loop 1\n","  Outer loop 2, Inner loop 2\n","  Outer loop 3, Inner loop 1\n","  Outer loop 3, Inner loop 2\n","  ```\n","\n","---\n","\n","## **4. Loops with `else` Clause**\n","\n","- Python allows using the **`else`** clause with both `for` and `while` loops. The **`else`** block executes when the loop completes normally (i.e., not terminated by `break`).\n","- **Analogy**: It’s like finishing a project and then celebrating at the end.\n","\n","#### **Example with `for` loop:**\n","```python\n","for i in range(3):\n","    print(i)\n","else:\n","    print(\"Loop completed!\")\n","```\n","\n","- **Output**:\n","  ```\n","  0\n","  1\n","  2\n","  Loop completed!\n","  ```\n","\n","#### **Example with `while` loop:**\n","```python\n","x = 0\n","while x < 3:\n","    print(x)\n","    x += 1\n","else:\n","    print(\"Loop completed!\")\n","```\n","\n","- **Output**:\n","  ```\n","  0\n","  1\n","  2\n","  Loop completed!\n","  ```\n","\n","---\n","\n","## **5. Loops with Collections**\n","\n","### **1. Looping through Lists**\n","- You can loop through elements in a **list** using a `for` loop.\n","- **Analogy**: It’s like picking fruits from a tree; you take each fruit until the tree is bare.\n","\n","#### **Example:**\n","```python\n","numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]\n","for number in numbers:\n","    print(number)\n","```\n","- **Output**:\n","  ```\n","  1\n","  2\n","  3\n","  4\n","  ```\n","\n","### **2. Looping through Dictionaries**\n","- Use `.items()` to iterate through **key-value pairs** of a dictionary.\n","- **Analogy**: Imagine a shelf with labeled boxes. You check each box (key) to see what’s inside (value).\n","\n","#### **Example:**\n","```python\n","person = {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 25}\n","for key, value in person.items():\n","    print(f\"{key}: {value}\")\n","```\n","- **Output**:\n","  ```\n","  name: Alice\n","  age: 25\n","  ```\n","\n","### **3. Looping through Strings**\n","- Strings can be looped over character by character.\n","- **Analogy**: Think of reading a sentence one letter at a time.\n","\n","#### **Example:**\n","```python\n","for char in \"Python\":\n","    print(char)\n","```\n","- **Output**:\n","  ```\n","  P\n","  y\n","  t\n","  h\n","  o\n","  n\n","  ```\n","\n","---\n","\n","## **6. `enumerate()` for Indexed Loops**\n","\n","- The `enumerate()` function allows you to loop over a sequence and retrieve both the **index** and **value** of each element.\n","- **Analogy**: Like having a numbered list of tasks where you keep track of what you’ve completed.\n","\n","#### **Example:**\n","```python\n","names = [\"Alice\", \"Bob\", \"Charlie\"]\n","for index, name in enumerate(names):\n","    print(f\"Index {index}: {name}\")\n","```\n","- **Output**:\n","  ```\n","  Index 0: Alice\n","  Index 1: Bob\n","  Index 2: Charlie\n","  ```\n","\n","---\n","\n","## **7. Com\n","\n","prehensions**\n","\n","- **List Comprehensions** provide a concise way to create lists. They consist of brackets containing an expression followed by a `for` clause.\n","- **Analogy**: Think of it as a quick way to gather ingredients for a recipe.\n","\n","#### **Example:**\n","```python\n","squares = [x**2 for x in range(5)]\n","print(squares)\n","```\n","- **Output**:\n","  ```\n","  [0, 1, 4, 9, 16]\n","  ```\n","\n","---\n","\n","## **Questions for Review:**\n","\n","1. **Define a loop in Python.**\n","2. **What is the difference between `for` and `while` loops?**\n","3. **Explain the purpose of the `break` and `continue` statements with examples.**\n","4. **What is list comprehension? Provide an example.**\n","5. **How can you loop through a dictionary in Python?**\n","6. **What happens if you forget to update the condition variable in a `while` loop?**\n","\n","---"],"metadata":{"id":"q1e_0S_TsGBR"}}]}
