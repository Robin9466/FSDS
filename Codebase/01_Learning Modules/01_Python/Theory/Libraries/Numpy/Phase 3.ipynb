Linear Algebra with NumPy**\n","\n","NumPy has a powerful `numpy.linalg` module that provides tools to perform a wide range of linear algebra operations. Below are the key concepts:\n","\n","1. **Dot Product and Matrix Multiplication**\n","   - **Dot Product**: The dot product is the sum of the products of the corresponding elements in two arrays. It is commonly used in various calculations, such as projections in geometry.\n","     - **Example**:\n","       ```python\n","       import numpy as np\n","\n","       # Define two 1-D arrays\n","       a = np.array([1, 2, 3])\n","       b = np.array([4, 5, 6])\n","\n","       # Calculate dot product\n","       dot_product = np.dot(a, b)\n","       print(\"Dot Product:\", dot_product)\n","       # Output: 32\n","       ```\n","   - **Matrix Multiplication**: This involves multiplying two matrices according to the rule that the number of columns in the first matrix must equal the number of rows in the second matrix. This is fundamental in transforming data or solving systems of equations.\n","     - **Example**:\n","       ```python\n","       # Define two 2-D matrices\n","       matrix1 = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])\n","       matrix2 = np.array([[5, 6], [7, 8]])\n","\n","       # Perform matrix multiplication\n","       result = np.matmul(matrix1, matrix2)\n","       print(\"Matrix Multiplication:\\n\", result)\n","       # Output:\n","       # [[19 22]\n","       #  [43 50]]\n","       ```\n","\n","2. **Determinants, Inverses, and Eigenvalues**\n","   - **Determinant**: A scalar value calculated from a square matrix. The determinant can reveal if a matrix is invertible (non-zero determinant indicates it is invertible).\n","     - **Example**:\n","       ```python\n","       # Calculate the determinant\n","       matrix = np.array([[4, 6], [3, 8]])\n","       determinant = np.linalg.det(matrix)\n","       print(\"Determinant:\", determinant)\n","       # Output: 14.0\n","       ```\n","   - **Inverse**: A matrix that, when multiplied by the original matrix, results in an identity matrix. It is used in solving equations.\n","     - **Example**:\n","       ```python\n","       # Find the inverse of a matrix\n","       inverse = np.linalg.inv(matrix)\n","       print(\"Inverse:\\n\", inverse)\n","       # Output:\n","       # [[ 0.57142857 -0.42857143]\n","       #  [-0.21428571  0.28571429]]\n","       ```\n","   - **Eigenvalues**: Scalars associated with a matrix that describe certain properties of the transformation represented by the matrix. These are crucial in fields like machine learning for understanding variance.\n","     - **Example**:\n","       ```python\n","       # Calculate eigenvalues\n","       values, vectors = np.linalg.eig(matrix)\n","       print(\"Eigenvalues:\", values)\n","       print(\"Eigenvectors:\\n\", vectors)\n","       ```\n","\n","3. **Solving Linear Equations with `numpy.linalg`**\n","   - NumPy allows for solving systems of linear equations efficiently using the `numpy.linalg.solve` function.\n","     - **Example**: Solve the system of equations:\n","       \\[\n","       3x + 4y = 7\n","       \\]\n","       \\[\n","       2x - y = -1\n","       \\]\n","       ```python\n","       # Define coefficients and constants\n","       coefficients = np.array([[3, 4], [2, -1]])\n","       constants = np.array([7, -1])\n","\n","       # Solve the system of equations\n","       solution = np.linalg.solve(coefficients, constants)\n","       print(\"Solution (x, y):\", solution)\n","       # Output: [1. 1.]\n","       ```\n","\n","---\n","\n","#### **9. Advanced Array Functions**\n","\n","NumPy provides several advanced functions for manipulating and analyzing arrays, which are useful for data analysis.\n","\n","1. **Sorting Arrays with `numpy.sort`**\n","   - The `numpy.sort` function sorts arrays in ascending order by default. It can be useful for organizing data or preparing for further analysis.\n","     - **Example**:\n","       ```python\n","       # Unsorted array\n","       array = np.array([5, 2, 9, 1, 7])\n","\n","       # Sort the array\n","       sorted_array = np.sort(array)\n","       print(\"Sorted Array:\", sorted_array)\n","       # Output: [1 2 5 7 9]\n","       ```\n","\n","2. **Searching Within Arrays**\n","   - NumPy provides several functions for locating elements within arrays:\n","     - **`argmax`**: Returns the index of the maximum element in the array.\n","       - **Example**:\n","         ```python\n","         array = np.array([10, 50, 20, 70, 40])\n","         max_index = np.argmax(array)\n","         print(\"Index of Max Element:\", max_index)\n","         # Output: 3\n","         ```\n","     - **`argmin`**: Returns the index of the minimum element.\n","       - **Example**:\n","         ```python\n","         min_index = np.argmin(array)\n","         print(\"Index of Min Element:\", min_index)\n","         # Output: 0\n","         ```\n","     - **`where`**: Returns the indices where a condition is true.\n","       - **Example**:\n","         ```python\n","         # Find indices where elements are greater than 30\n","         indices = np.where(array > 30)\n","         print(\"Indices where elements > 30:\", indices)\n","         # Output: (array([1, 3]),)\n","         ```\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **Summary**\n","- In **Linear Algebra**, NumPy provides comprehensive tools for performing operations like dot products, matrix multiplication, determinants, matrix inversion, and solving linear systems of equations.\n","- In **Advanced Array Functions**, sorting and searching capabilities allow for efficient data manipulation and analysis, aiding in tasks such as data preparation and feature extraction.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"eMILc9LJOLFP"}}]}
