It is often described as a \\\"batteries included\\\" language due to its comprehensive standard library.[33][34]\\n\\nGuido van Rossum began working on Python in the late 1980s as a successor to the ABC programming language and first released it in 1991 as Python 0.9.0.[35] Python 2.0 was released in 2000 and introduced new features such as list comprehensions, cycle-detecting garbage collection, reference counting, and Unicode support. Python 3.0, released in 2008, was a major revision that is not completely backward-compatible with earlier versions. Python 2 was discontinued with version 2.7.18 in 2020.[36]\\n\\nPython consistently ranks as one of the most popular programming languagesc\"\n","\n","    vowels = \"AEIOUaeiou\"\n","    mylist = []\n","\n","    index = 0\n","    while index < len(string):\n","        if string[index] not in vowels:\n","            mylist.append(string[index])\n","        index += 1\n","\n","    filtered_text = ''.join(mylist)\n","    print(filtered_text)\n","q4()"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"-OeQOrIXqlzj","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1711455216879,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":833,"user":{"displayName":"Robin Raj","userId":"13779324533089785610"}},"outputId":"d90e4dd0-182f-4459-d575-5587fffeaf3c"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Pythn s  hgh-lvl, ntrprtd, gnrl-prps prgrmmng lngg. ts dsgn phlsphy mphszs cd rdblty wth th s f sgnfcnt ndnttn.[32]\n","\n","Pythn s dynmclly-typd nd grbg-cllctd. t spprts mltpl prgrmmng prdgms, ncldng strctrd (prtclrly prcdrl), bjct-rntd nd fnctnl prgrmmng. t s ftn dscrbd s  \"bttrs ncldd\" lngg d t ts cmprhnsv stndrd lbrry.[33][34]\n","\n","Gd vn Rssm bgn wrkng n Pythn n th lt 1980s s  sccssr t th BC prgrmmng lngg nd frst rlsd t n 1991 s Pythn 0.9.0.[35] Pythn 2.0 ws rlsd n 2000 nd ntrdcd nw ftrs sch s lst cmprhnsns, cycl-dtctng grbg cllctn, rfrnc cntng, nd ncd spprt.
