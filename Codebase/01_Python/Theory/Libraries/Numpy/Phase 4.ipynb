Applying NumPy Operations to Clean, Filter, and Transform Datasets**\n","\n","- **Data Cleaning**:\n","  - Use `numpy.nan` to handle missing values.\n","  - Replace invalid or corrupted data using conditions (`np.where()`).\n","  - Remove outliers using statistical methods like z-score (`scipy.stats.zscore`) to filter extreme values.\n","  - Example:\n","    ```python\n","    import numpy as np\n","    \n","    # Replace NaN values with mean\n","    data = np.array([1, 2, np.nan, 4, 5])\n","    cleaned_data = np.where(np.isnan(data), np.nanmean(data), data)\n","    ```\n","    \n","- **Data Filtering**:\n","  - Use boolean indexing to filter out specific rows or values.\n","  - Example: Filtering values greater than a threshold.\n","    ```python\n","    # Example of filtering values\n","    data = np.array([10, 20, 30, 40, 50])\n","    filtered_data = data[data > 25]  # [30, 40, 50]\n","    ```\n","    \n","- **Data Transformation**:\n","  - Use vectorized operations for speed (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/` directly on arrays).\n","  - Apply mathematical functions (`np.log()`, `np.sqrt()`, etc.) across datasets.\n","  - Example: Normalizing data between 0 and 1.\n","    ```python\n","    # Normalization example\n","    data = np.array([10, 20, 30, 40, 50])\n","    normalized_data = (data - data.min()) / (data.max() - data.min())\n","    ```\n","\n","### **2. Integration with Pandas**\n","\n","- **Pandas DataFrame Creation**:\n","  - Convert NumPy arrays into Pandas DataFrames using `pd.DataFrame()`.\n","  - Use Pandas for more advanced operations such as merging datasets, grouping, or dealing with missing data.\n","\n","- **Conversion Examples**:\n","  ```python\n","  import pandas as pd\n","\n","  # Convert NumPy array to Pandas DataFrame\n","  np_array = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])\n","  df = pd.DataFrame(np_array, columns=['A', 'B', 'C'])\n","  ```\n","\n","- **Operations**:\n","  - Use Pandas to manipulate data easily with NumPy support for calculations.\n","  - Integrate filtering, cleaning, and transforming NumPy data within a DataFrame.\n","\n","### **3. Mini-Project 4: Data Cleaning and Analysis using NumPy**\n","\n","#### **Objective**:\n","- Load a dataset from a CSV file using NumPy.\n","- Perform basic data cleaning tasks.\n","- Analyze the dataset for patterns or trends.\n","\n","#### **Step-by-Step**:\n","1. **Loading Data**:\n","   ```python\n","   # Load CSV using NumPy\n","   data = np.genfromtxt('data.csv', delimiter=',', skip_header=1)\n","   ```\n","\n","2. **Cleaning Data**:\n","   - Replace missing values with median or mean.\n","   - Normalize numeric data for consistency.\n","   - Remove outliers based on a threshold.\n","\n","3. **Analyzing Data**:\n","   - Calculate mean, median, or any statistical measure.\n","   - Use NumPy functions like `np.mean()`, `np.median()`, `np.sum()` for quick analysis.\n","   \n","4. **Sample Analysis Code**:\n","   ```python\n","   # Example analysis - Calculating mean and median\n","   column_mean = np.mean(data[:, 2])  # Mean of third column\n","   column_median = np.median(data[:, 2])  # Median of third column\n","   ```\n","\n","---\n","\n","## **Visualization with NumPy Data**\n","\n","### **1. Using Libraries Like Matplotlib and Seaborn to Visualize Data**\n","\n","- **Matplotlib**:\n","  - Create simple plots (`plt.plot()`, `plt.scatter()`, etc.).\n","  - Use histograms (`plt.hist()`) to understand data distribution.\n","  - Example: Plotting a line graph.\n","    ```python\n","    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","\n","    x = np.arange(0, 10, 0.1)\n","    y = np.sin(x)\n","    \n","    plt.plot(x, y)\n","    plt.title('Sine Wave')\n","    plt.xlabel('X-axis')\n","    plt.ylabel('Y-axis')\n","    plt.show()\n","    ```\n","\n","- **Seaborn**:\n","  - High-level visualization library built on top of Matplotlib.\n","  - Ideal for visualizing statistical relationships with fewer lines of code.\n","  - Use Seaborn for scatter plots, box plots, and heatmaps.\n","\n","### **2.
