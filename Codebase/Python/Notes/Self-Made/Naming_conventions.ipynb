Here are the common naming conventions:\n","\n","1. **Variable Names**: Use lowercase letters with words separated by underscores.\n","   - Example: `total_price`, `user_name`\n","\n","2. **Function Names**: Similar to variable names, use lowercase with underscores separating words.\n","   - Example: `calculate_area()`, `send_email()`\n","\n","3. **Class Names**: Use PascalCase (also known as CamelCase) where each word starts with a capital letter.\n","   - Example: `CarModel`, `EmployeeDetails`\n","\n","4. **Constant Names**: Use all uppercase letters with words separated by underscores.\n","   - Example: `MAX_SPEED`, `PI`\n","\n","5. **Private Variables or Functions**: Start with a single underscore (`_`) to indicate that a variable or function is intended for internal use.\n","   - Example: `_private_method()`, `_internal_data`\n","\n","6. **Magic Methods**: These are special methods surrounded by double underscores. They are also known as \"dunder\" methods.\n","   - Example: `__init__()`, `__str__()`\n","\n","### Key Guidelines:\n","- **Keep names descriptive but concise**: Variable and function names should convey their purpose.\n","  - Good: `calculate_total`, `num_students`\n","  - Bad: `x`, `temp`\n","\n","- **Avoid single-letter names**, except in small loops (like `i` in `for i in range()`).\n","\n","By following these conventions, your Python code will be more understandable and aligned with community standards."],"metadata":{"id":"YOoWCgjqG4E5"}}]}
