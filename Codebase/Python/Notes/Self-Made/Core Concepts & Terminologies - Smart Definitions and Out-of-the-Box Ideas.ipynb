It uses symbols and arrows to show the steps of a task and the decisions to be made. Think of it as a roadmap for how to solve a problem.\n","\n","#### Example:\n","If you want to check if a number is **even** or **odd**, the flowchart might look like this:\n","\n","```\n","[Start] → [Input number] → [Is the number divisible by 2?]\n","                            ↓Yes                      ↓No\n","                          [Even]                  [Odd]\n","                            ↓                         ↓\n","                         [End]                    [End]\n","```\n","\n","In this visual:\n","- Rectangles show tasks (e.g., input number).\n","- Diamonds show decisions (e.g., is the number divisible by 2?).\n","- Arrows show the flow of the process.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### 2. **Pseudocode**\n","**Pseudocode** is a way to write down how a program will work using plain language. It’s not actual code, but a simple version of it that explains the steps clearly.\n","\n","#### Example:\n","Let’s say you want to **find the largest of two numbers**:\n","\n","**Pseudocode**:\n","1. Start\n","2. Input two numbers, A and B\n","3. If A is greater than B, print \"A is larger\"\n","4. Else, print \"B is larger\"\n","5. End\n","\n","This is a straightforward, human-readable explanation of what the program will do. It's like a rough draft before writing real code.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### 3. **Algorithm**\n","An **algorithm** is just a list of steps that tell you how to solve a problem. Think of it like a recipe: it tells you what to do step by step.\n","\n","#### Example:\n","Let’s make an **algorithm** for making a sandwich:\n","\n","1. Take two slices of bread.\n","2. Spread butter on one slice.\n","3. Put a slice of cheese on top of the butter.\n","4. Add another slice of bread on top.\n","5. Your sandwich is ready to eat!\n","\n","An algorithm for finding the largest of two numbers would be:\n","\n","1. Start.\n","2. Input two numbers.\n","3. Compare the two numbers.\n","4. If the first number is greater, that’s the largest.\n","5. If the second number is greater, that’s the largest.\n","6. End.\n","\n","Algorithms can be written in simple language or with code, depending on who’s using them.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### Visual Representations\n","\n","#### Flowchart Example:\n","Here's a **flowchart** for checking if a number is positive or negative:\n","\n","```\n","[Start] → [Input number] → [Is the number > 0?]\n","                            ↓Yes                      ↓No\n","                        [Positive]               [Negative]\n","                            ↓                         ↓\n","                         [End]                    [End]\n","```\n","\n","#### Pseudocode Example:\n","Here’s how you might write pseudocode to check if a number is positive or negative:\n","\n","1. Start\n","2. Input a number\n","3. If the number is greater than 0, print \"Positive\"\n","4. Else, print \"Negative\"\n","5. End\n","\n","#### Algorithm Example:\n","For checking if a number is positive or negative:\n","\n","1. Start\n","2. Input a number\n","3. Check if the number is greater than 0\n","4. If true, it's positive; if false, it's negative\n","5. End\n","\n","---\n","\n","By using flowcharts, pseudocode, and algorithms, you can **plan your logic** clearly before diving into writing code! These are all useful tools to think through a problem step by step.\n","\n","Video tutorial for Flow of Program - Flowcharts & Pseudocode\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"bxl3eAR5nQKp"}}]}
