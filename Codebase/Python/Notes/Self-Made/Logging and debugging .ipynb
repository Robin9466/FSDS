Logging and Debugging in Python**\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **1. What is Debugging?**\n","- **Debugging** is the process of finding and fixing errors (bugs) in the code.\n","- It helps ensure the program runs smoothly without unexpected behavior.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **2. Common Debugging Techniques**\n","\n","1. **Print Statements**:\n","   - A simple way to debug is by adding `print()` statements at various points in the code to check values.\n","   - Example:\n","     ```python\n","     x = 10\n","     print(f\"Value of x: {x}\")\n","     ```\n","\n","2. **Assertions**:\n","   - `assert` is used to check if a condition is true. If false, it raises an `AssertionError`.\n","   - Example:\n","     ```python\n","     assert x > 0, \"x should be positive\"\n","     ```\n","\n","3. **Using IDE Debugger**:\n","   - Modern IDEs like PyCharm and VS Code have built-in debuggers to step through the code, set breakpoints, and inspect variables.\n","\n","4. **Error Handling (Try/Except)**:\n","   - Handle exceptions to prevent the program from crashing due to unforeseen errors.\n","   - Example:\n","     ```python\n","     try:\n","         result = 10 / 0\n","     except ZeroDivisionError:\n","         print(\"Cannot divide by zero!\")\n","     ```\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **3. Introduction to Logging**\n","\n","- **Logging** provides a way to track events while the program runs, which can be helpful for debugging and monitoring.\n","- Instead of using `print()`, logging provides more flexibility and control.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **4. Why Use Logging Over Print?**\n","\n","- **Print** is only useful during development. Logging can:\n","  - Differentiate levels of severity (e.g., info, warning, error).\n","  - Output logs to a file for future reference.\n","  - Provide timestamps and other metadata.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **5. Setting Up Logging in Python**\n","\n","- Use the **`logging`** module for logging purposes.\n","  \n","#### **Basic Logging Example**:\n","```python\n","import logging\n","\n","logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)\n","logging.info(\"This is an info message\")\n","logging.warning(\"This is a warning message\")\n","logging.error(\"This is an error message\")\n","```\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **6. Log Levels**\n","\n","- **Log levels** indicate the severity of the message being logged.\n","- Common log levels (from lowest to highest severity):\n","  \n","  | Log Level       | Description                               |\n","  |-----------------|-------------------------------------------|\n","  | **DEBUG**       | Detailed information, typically for debugging. |\n","  | **INFO**        | Confirmation that things are working as expected. |\n","  | **WARNING**     | An indication that something unexpected happened. |\n","  | **ERROR**       | A serious problem that prevents program execution. |\n","  | **CRITICAL**    | A very serious error, program may be unable to run. |\n","\n","#### **Example**:\n","```python\n","logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)\n","logging.debug(\"Debugging information\")\n","logging.info(\"Informational message\")\n","logging.warning(\"Warning: Something unexpected happened!\")\n","logging.error(\"Error occurred!\")\n","logging.critical(\"Critical error!\")\n","```\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **7. Logging to a File**\n","\n","- You can log messages to a **file** instead of the console.\n","\n","#### **Example**:\n","```python\n","logging.basicConfig(filename='app.log', level=logging.INFO)\n","logging.info(\"Logging into a file now\")\n","```\n","\n","- This will create a file called `app.log` and store the log messages.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **8. Customizing Log Format**\n","\n","- You can customize the **format** of log messages to include time, log level, message, etc.\n","\n","#### **Example**:\n","```python\n","logging.basicConfig(\n","    filename='app.log',\n","    level=logging.DEBUG,\n","    format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s'\n",")\n","logging.info(\"This is a formatted log message.\")\n","```\n","\n","- This will output logs like:\n","  ```\n","  2024-09-11 14:45:12,123 - INFO - This is a formatted log message.\n","  ```\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **9. Exceptions with Logging**\n","\n","- You can use logging to capture exceptions with the **`exc_info`** argument.\n","\n","#### **Example**:\n","```python\n","try:\n","    result = 10 / 0\n","except ZeroDivisionError:\n","    logging.error(\"Exception occurred\", exc_info=True)\n","```\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **10. Debugging Using the `pdb` Module**\n","\n","- **`pdb`** is Pythonâ€™s built-in **debugger**.\n","- You can use it to step through your code and inspect values, set breakpoints, and control program execution.\n","\n","#### **Using `pdb`**:\n","- To use the debugger, simply insert the following code where you want to start debugging:\n","  ```python\n","  import pdb\n","  pdb.set_trace()\n","  ```\n","\n","#### **Common `pdb` Commands**:\n","| Command | Description                            |\n","|---------|----------------------------------------|\n","| **n**   | Step to the next line                  |\n","| **c**   | Continue until the next breakpoint     |\n","| **l**   | List the code around the current line  |\n","| **p**   | Print the value of a variable          |\n","| **q**   | Quit the debugger                      |\n","\n","#### **Example**:\n","```python\n","import pdb\n","\n","def divide(a, b):\n","    pdb.set_trace()  # Start debugger here\n","    return a / b\n","\n","divide(10, 0)\n","```\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **11. Logging in Real-World Scenarios**\n","\n","1. **Monitoring**: Log all the important events for monitoring (e.g., server health, app errors).\n","2. **Debugging**: Use logs to track errors in production environments.\n","3. **Auditing**: Keep a record of all operations for compliance and auditing purposes.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **12. Best Practices in Logging**\n","\n","1. **Use appropriate log levels** to avoid unnecessary verbosity.\n","2. **Log important events**, especially errors and warnings.\n","3. Avoid logging **sensitive information** like passwords.\n","4. **Rotate log files** to prevent them from growing too large.\n","5. Always log with **context**, so it's easier to trace the issue later.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **Summary**:\n","\n","- **Debugging** involves identifying and fixing bugs using techniques like `print()`, assertions, try/except, and using a debugger like `pdb`.\n","- **Logging** is essential for tracking events in an application. It provides insights into how a program is functioning and helps in debugging without halting the execution.\n","- Always use **log levels** to classify the importance of messages, and opt for **file logging** in production environments for better tracking.\n","\n","---\n"],"metadata":{"id":"jNEwQOyNrUtD"}}]}
