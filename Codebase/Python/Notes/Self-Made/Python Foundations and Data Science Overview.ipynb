        "A programming language is a set of instructions used to communicate with computers. It's used to write software, websites, and apps. It helps convert human-readable code into something machines understand.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Example:** Think of it as a language you speak with your computer to make it do things, just like you use English to communicate with others.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **2. Compiler vs Interpreter**\n",
        "- **Compiler:** Translates the entire program into machine code before execution. Faster at runtime but slower in translating code.\n",
        "- **Interpreter:** Translates code line-by-line during execution. Easier to debug but slower.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Example:** A compiler is like translating a book (all at once), while an interpreter is like translating each sentence as you read it.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **3. Python: Interpreter or Compiler?**\n",
        "Python is an interpreted language. It translates code line by line when executed. This makes Python easier for beginners and faster to debug.\n",
