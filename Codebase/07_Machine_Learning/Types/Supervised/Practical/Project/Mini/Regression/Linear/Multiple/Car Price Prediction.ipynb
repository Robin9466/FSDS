Mini-Project: Predicting Car Prices**\n","**Objective**: Build a model to predict car prices based on features such as **car age**, **mileage**, and **engine size**.\n","\n","**Steps**:\n","1. **Collect Data**: You can collect a dataset (like from Kaggle) with features such as age, mileage, engine size, and price.\n","   \n","2. **Preprocess Data**: Clean and process the dataset (handle missing values, outliers, etc.).\n","   \n","3. **Apply Multiple Linear Regression**: Model the relationship between car features (predictor variables) and price (dependent variable).\n","   \n","4. **Evaluate the Model**: Use R-squared (R²), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Mean Squared Error (MSE) to evaluate your model.\n","\n","**Code Example** (using `pandas` for data preprocessing):\n","```python\n","import pandas as pd\n","from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n","from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression\n","from sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error, mean_squared_error, r2_score\n","\n","# Load dataset\n","df = pd.read_csv('car_data.csv')\n","\n","# Preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, etc.)\n","df = df.dropna()  # Example of handling missing values\n","\n","# Define predictors (X) and target variable (y)\n","X = df[['Age', 'Mileage', 'EngineSize']]  # Features\n","y = df['Price']  # Target variable\n","\n","# Split data into training and testing sets\n","X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)\n","\n","# Create and train the model\n","model = LinearRegression()\n","model.fit(X_train, y_train)\n","\n","# Make predictions\n","y_pred = model.predict(X_test)\n","\n","# Evaluate the model\n","print(\"R-squared:\", r2_score(y_test, y_pred))\n","print(\"Mean Absolute Error:\", mean_absolute_error(y_test, y_pred))\n","print(\"Mean Squared Error:\", mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred))\n","```\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **4. Practical Tips for Linear Regression in Data Science**:\n","1. **Check Assumptions**: Ensure that your data meets the assumptions of linear regression (linearity, homoscedasticity, independence, normality of errors).\n","2. **Scaling**: When dealing with multiple features, scale your data if necessary (StandardScaler or MinMaxScaler in scikit-learn).\n","3. **Correlation**: Check for multicollinearity. If predictors are highly correlated, it can destabilize the model. Use variance inflation factor (VIF) to detect this.\n","4. **Model Evaluation**: Use metrics like R-squared, Adjusted R-squared, RMSE, MAE, and MSE to evaluate the performance of your model.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **In Conclusion**:\n","By applying linear regression to real-world datasets and working through these exercises and mini-projects, you'll gain a deeper understanding of how linear regression works and how it can be applied to various data science tasks."],"metadata":{"id":"1gZiiGK0o2Mw"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import pandas as pd\n","import numpy as
