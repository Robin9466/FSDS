The `file` object can be a text file, a stream like `sys.stdout`, or any other writable object.\n","\n","- **`output`**: This is the result of `sep.join(map(str, args))`, which is a single string created from the function arguments.\n","  \n","- **`end`**: This is the value of the `end` argument (by default, a newline `'\\n'`), which is appended to the output.
