Include a method to display the book information.\n","   ```python\n","   class Book:\n","       def __init__(self, title, author, year):\n","           self.title = title\n","           self.author = author\n","           self.year = year\n","       \n","       def display_info(self):\n","           print(f\"'{self.title}' by {self.author}, published in {self.year}\")\n","   \n","   # Create an instance and display its information\n","   my_book = Book(\"1984\", \"George Orwell\", 1949)\n","   my_book.display_info()\n","   ```\n","\n","### Assignment 2: Constructor Types\n","2. **Implement a `Rectangle` class** with both a default constructor and a parameterized constructor. The default constructor should initialize width and height to 1, while the parameterized constructor takes width and height as arguments. Include a method to calculate the area.\n","   ```python\n","   class Rectangle:\n","       def __init__(self, width=1, height=1):\n","           self.width = width\n","           self.height = height\n","       \n","       def area(self):\n","           return self.width * self.height\n","   \n","   # Create instances using both constructors\n","   rect1 = Rectangle()\n","   rect2 = Rectangle(4, 5)\n","   print(rect1.area())  # Output: 1\n","   print(rect2.area())  # Output: 20\n","   ```\n","\n","### Assignment 3: Encapsulation\n","3. **Create a `BankAccount` class** with private attributes for balance. Include methods for deposit, withdraw, and checking balance. Ensure that the balance cannot be accessed directly from outside the class.\n","   ```python\n","   class BankAccount:\n","       def __init__(self, initial_balance):\n","           self.__balance = initial_balance\n","       \n","       def deposit(self, amount):\n","           if amount > 0:\n","               self.__balance += amount\n","       \n","       def withdraw(self, amount):\n","           if 0 < amount <= self.__balance:\n","               self.__balance -= amount\n","               return amount\n","           else:\n","               return \"Insufficient funds\"\n","       \n","       def get_balance(self):\n","           return self.__balance\n","   \n","   # Test the BankAccount class\n","   account = BankAccount(1000)\n","   account.deposit(500)\n","   print(account.get_balance())  # Output: 1500\n","   ```\n","\n","### Assignment 4: Inheritance\n","4. **Design an `Employee` class** as a base class with attributes for name and salary. Then create two subclasses: `FullTimeEmployee` and `PartTimeEmployee`, each with their own methods to calculate salary based on hours worked and a rate.\n","   ```python\n","   class Employee:\n","       def __init__(self, name, salary):\n","           self.name = name\n","           self.salary = salary\n","   \n","   class FullTimeEmployee(Employee):\n","       def calculate_salary(self):\n","           return self.salary\n","   \n","   class PartTimeEmployee(Employee):\n","       def __init__(self, name, hourly_rate, hours_worked):\n","           super().__init__(name, hourly_rate * hours_worked)\n","           self.hourly_rate = hourly_rate\n","           self.hours_worked = hours_worked\n","       \n","       def calculate_salary(self):\n","           return self.hourly_rate * self.hours_worked\n","   \n","   # Create instances and display their salaries\n","   full_time = FullTimeEmployee(\"Alice\", 60000)\n","   part_time = PartTimeEmployee(\"Bob\", 20, 15)\n","   print(full_time.calculate_salary())  # Output: 60000\n","   print(part_time.calculate_salary())   # Output: 300\n","   ```\n","\n","### Assignment 5: Polymorphism\n","5. **Create a `Shape` base class** with a method `area()`. Then implement subclasses `Circle` and `Triangle` that override the `area()` method. Write a function that takes a shape and prints its area.\n","   ```python\n","   class Shape:\n","       def area(self):\n","           pass\n","   \n","   class Circle(Shape):\n","       def __init__(self, radius):\n","           self.radius = radius\n","       \n","       def area(self):\n","           return 3.14 * self.radius ** 2\n","   \n","   class Triangle(Shape):\n","       def __init__(self, base, height):\n","           self.base = base\n","           self.height = height\n","       \n","       def area(self):\n","           return 0.5 * self.base * self.height\n","   \n","   def print_area(shape):\n","       print(\"Area:\", shape.area())\n","   \n","   # Create instances and print areas\n","   circle = Circle(5)\n","   triangle = Triangle(4, 3)\n","   print_area(circle)    # Output: Area: 78.5\n","   print_area(triangle)  # Output: Area: 6.0\n","   ```\n","\n","### Summary\n","These assignments cover fundamental OOP concepts including class creation, constructors, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
