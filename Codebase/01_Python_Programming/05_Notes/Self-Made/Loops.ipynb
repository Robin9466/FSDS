What are Loops?**\n","- **Loops** are used to repeatedly execute a block of code until a specified condition is met.\n","- Python supports two main types of loops:\n","  1. **`for` loop**\n","  2. **`while` loop**\n","\n","---\n","\n","## **2. `for` Loop**\n","\n","### **What is a `for` Loop?**\n","- The `for` loop iterates over a sequence (like a list, tuple, string) and executes the code for each item.\n","\n","#### Syntax:\n","```python\n","for variable in sequence:\n","    # Code block\n","```\n","\n","#### Example:\n","```python\n","fruits = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]\n","for fruit in fruits:\n","    print(fruit)\n","```\n","- **Output**:\n","  ```\n","  apple\n","  banana\n","  cherry\n","  ```\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **Using `range()` in `for` Loop**\n","- **`range()`** generates a sequence of numbers, which is often used with `for` loops.\n","\n","#### Example:\n","```python\n","for i in range(5):\n","    print(i)\n","```\n","- **Output**:\n","  ```\n","  0\n","  1\n","  2\n","  3\n","  4\n","  ```\n","\n","#### **Visualizing `range()`**:\n","\n","| range() | Output  |\n","|---------|---------|\n","| `range(5)`   | 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 |\n","| `range(1, 5)`| 1, 2, 3, 4   |\n","| `range(1, 10, 2)`| 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 (step of 2) |\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **Nested `for` Loops**\n","- Loops inside loops are called **nested loops**.\n","\n","#### Example:\n","```python\n","for i in range(3):\n","    for j in range(2):\n","        print(f\"i={i}, j={j}\")\n","```\n","\n","- **Output**:\n","  ```\n","  i=0, j=0\n","  i=0, j=1\n","  i=1, j=0\n","  i=1, j=1\n","  i=2, j=0\n","  i=2, j=1\n","  ```\n","\n","---\n","\n","## **3. `while` Loop**\n","\n","### **What is a `while` Loop?**\n","- The **`while` loop** executes as long as a specified condition is `True`.\n","\n","#### Syntax:\n","```python\n","while condition:\n","    # Code block\n","```\n","\n","#### Example:\n","```python\n","count = 0\n","while count < 5:\n","    print(count)\n","    count += 1\n","```\n","\n","- **Output**:\n","  ```\n","  0\n","  1\n","  2\n","  3\n","  4\n","  ```\n","\n","### **Infinite Loop**\n","- A loop that never stops is called an **infinite loop**.\n","\n","#### Example (avoid using it):\n","```python\n","while True:\n","    print(\"This is an infinite loop\")\n","```\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **Using `break` and `continue`**\n","\n","1. **`break`**: Terminates the loop entirely when a condition is met.\n","  \n","#### Example:\n","```python\n","for i in range(10):\n","    if i == 5:\n","        break\n","    print(i)\n","```\n","- **Output**:\n","  ```\n","  0\n","  1\n","  2\n","  3\n","  4\n","  ```\n","\n","2. **`continue`**: Skips the current iteration and moves to the next.\n","\n","#### Example:\n","```python\n","for i in range(5):\n","    if i == 2:\n","        continue\n","    print(i)\n","```\n","- **Output**:\n","  ```\n","  0\n","  1\n","  3\n","  4\n","  ```\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **Nested `while` Loops**\n","- Just like `for` loops, **`while` loops** can be nested.\n","\n","#### Example:\n","```python\n","i = 1\n","while i <= 3:\n","    j = 1\n","    while j <= 2:\n","        print(f\"i={i}, j={j}\")\n","        j += 1\n","    i += 1\n","```\n","\n","- **Output**:\n","  ```\n","  i=1, j=1\n","  i=1, j=2\n","  i=2, j=1\n","  i=2, j=2\n","  i=3, j=1\n","  i=3, j=2\n","  ```\n","\n","---\n","\n","## **4. Loops with `else` Clause**\n","\n","- Python allows using the **`else`** clause with both `for` and `while` loops. The **`else`** block executes when the loop completes normally (i.e., not terminated by `break`).\n","\n","#### Example with `for` loop:\n","```python\n","for i in range(3):\n","    print(i)\n","else:\n","    print(\"Loop completed!\")\n","```\n","\n","- **Output**:\n","  ```\n","  0\n","  1\n","  2\n","  Loop completed!\n","  ```\n","\n","#### Example with `while` loop:\n","```python\n","x = 0\n","while x < 3:\n","    print(x)\n","    x += 1\n","else:\n","    print(\"Loop completed!\")\n","```\n","\n","- **Output**:\n","  ```\n","  0\n","  1\n","  2\n","  Loop completed!\n","  ```\n","\n","---\n","\n","## **5.
