What is a Programming Language (PL)?**\n","A programming language is a set of instructions used to communicate with computers. It's used to write software, websites, and apps. It helps convert human-readable code into something machines understand.\n","\n","- **Example:** Think of it as a language you speak with your computer to make it do things, just like you use English to communicate with others.\n","\n","### **2. Compiler vs Interpreter**\n","- **Compiler:** Translates the entire program into machine code before execution. Faster at runtime but slower in translating code.\n","- **Interpreter:** Translates code line-by-line during execution. Easier to debug but slower.\n","\n","- **Example:** A compiler is like translating a book (all at once), while an interpreter is like translating each sentence as you read it.\n","\n","### **3. Python: Interpreter or Compiler?**\n","Python is an interpreted language. It translates code line by line when executed. This makes Python easier for beginners and faster to debug.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **4. Software, Utilities, and Tools**\n","- **Software:** Programs or applications that run on a computer (e.g., browsers, games).\n","- **Utility:** Tools that perform basic functions like managing files or maintaining system health (e.g., antivirus software).\n","- **Tools:** Specific applications used by developers (e.g., text editors, debuggers).\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **5. Why Use Programming Languages?**\n","Programming languages help solve real-world problems by creating software that automates tasks, processes data, or controls hardware.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **6. History of Programming Languages**\n","- **First Language:** Assembly language in the 1940s.\n","- **Notable Inventions:**\n","   - **FORTRAN** (1957): First high-level PL by IBM, for scientific computing.\n","   - **COBOL** (1959): Focused on business.\n","   - **C** (1972): General-purpose.\n","   - **Python** (1991): Easy, versatile, interpreted.\n","\n","- **Goal:** To simplify complex computations and automate tasks for humans.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **7. Low-level vs High-level Languages**\n","- **Low-level Languages:** Close to machine language, like Assembly.

Dry Run, Manual Tracing, Debugging**\n","- **Dry Run:** Running the program in your mind to check logic.\n","- **Manual Tracing:** Following the flow of execution line-by-line with pen and paper.\n","- **Debugging:** Identifying and fixing errors in code.\n","\n","- **Why:** To find logical and runtime errors.\n","- **When:** Use it when the program doesn't work as expected.\n","- **How:** Use debugging tools or insert print statements to trace issues.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **9. Grammar in Programming Language**\n","Grammar defines how code should be written in a programming language. It consists of rules (syntax) that must be followed.\n","\n","- **Example:** In Python, indentation is critical. Forgetting it will raise an error.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **10.

It allows you to create a new sequence (sublist or substring) based on the specified start and end points without modifying the original sequence.\n","\n","### **Slicing Syntax**\n","\n","The general syntax for slicing is:\n","\n","```python\n","sequence[start:end:step]\n","```\n","\n","- **`start`**: The index where the slice begins (inclusive).\n","- **`end`**: The index where the slice ends (exclusive, meaning the element at this index is not included).\n","- **`step`**: (Optional) Determines the step size, i.e., how many elements to skip. The default value is `1`.\n","\n","#### Example with a list:\n","```python\n","lst = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60]\n","slice = lst[1:4]  # Output: [20, 30, 40]\n","```\n","\n","### **How Slicing Works:**\n","- **`start`**: Slicing starts from the element at the `start` index. If `start` is omitted, it defaults to `0` (the beginning of the sequence).\n","- **`end`**: Slicing stops just **before** the `end` index. If `end` is omitted, it defaults to the length of the sequence (i.e., slice until the end).\n","- **`step`**: If `step` is provided, it determines how many elements to skip. If itâ€™s not provided, the step defaults to `1` (which means it includes every element between `start` and `end`).\n","\n","### **Examples of Slicing:**\n","\n","#### 1. Basic Slicing (Start and End):\n","```python\n","lst = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\n","print(lst[2:5])  # Output: [2, 3, 4]\n","```\n","- **Explanation**: Starts at index `2` (element `2`) and stops **before** index `5` (element `5` is not included).\n","\n","#### 2. Omitting the `start` or `end`:\n","```python\n","# Omitting the start (starts from the beginning)\n","print(lst[:4])  # Output: [0, 1, 2, 3]\n","\n","# Omitting the end (goes to the end of the list)\n","print(lst[3:])  # Output: [3, 4, 5, 6]\n","```\n","\n","#### 3. Using `step`:\n","```python\n","lst = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70]\n","\n","# Slicing with a step of 2 (every second element)\n","print(lst[0:7:2])  # Output: [10, 30, 50, 70]\n","\n","# Slicing with a negative step (reverse order)\n","print(lst[::-1])   # Output: [70, 60, 50, 40, 30, 20, 10]\n","```\n","- **Explanation**: The step size `2` takes every second element. A negative step like `-1` reverses the sequence.\n","\n","### **Slicing in Strings:**\n","\n","Slicing works similarly for strings, as they are sequences of characters.\n","\n","```python\n","s = \"Python\"\n","print(s[1:4])  # Output: \"yth\"\n","print(s[:3])   # Output: \"Pyt\"\n","print(s[::-1]) # Output: \"nohtyP\" (reversed)\n","```\n","\n","### **Common Slicing Scenarios:**\n","\n","#### 1. **Extracting the first `n` elements**:\n","```python\n","lst = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n","print(lst[:3])  # Output: [1, 2, 3] (First 3 elements)\n","```\n","\n","#### 2. **Extracting the last `n` elements**:\n","```python\n","print(lst[-3:])  # Output: [3, 4, 5] (Last 3 elements)\n","```\n","\n","#### 3. **Reversing a sequence**:\n","```python\n","print(lst[::-1])  # Output: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]\n","```\n","\n","### **Slicing with Negative Indices:**\n","Python allows negative indices, where `-1` refers to the last element, `-2` to the second-last, and so on.\n","\n","```python\n","lst = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]\n","print(lst[-4:-1])  # Output: [20, 30, 40]\n","```\n","\n","- **Explanation**: Starts at index `-4` (second element) and stops before index `-1` (the last element).\n","\n","### **Key Points to Remember**:\n","1. **Inclusive start, exclusive end**: The slice starts from the `start` index and stops **before** the `end` index.\n","2. **Negative indices**: You can use negative indices to refer to elements from the end of the sequence.\n","3. **Step size**: You can define a step size to skip elements or reverse the order.\n","\n","### Summary:\n","- **Slicing** is a powerful way to retrieve specific portions of a sequence (list, string, etc.) using the format `sequence[start:end:step]`.\n","- It allows flexible indexing, including using negative indices and specifying step sizes for skipping elements or reversing the sequence.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"WWlL2jmDtfEU"}}]}
