What Are Generators?**\n","\n","- **Generators** are a type of iterable, like lists or tuples, but they **generate values on the fly** instead of storing them in memory.\n","- They are memory-efficient, especially when dealing with large datasets, as they yield items one by one.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **2. Generator Functions vs Normal Functions**\n","\n","- A **generator function** is defined like a normal function, but instead of returning a value using `return`, it uses `yield`.\n","- The **`yield`** keyword pauses the function and returns a value. The function can be resumed later, picking up from where it left off.\n","\n","---\n","\n","#### **Example of a Generator Function**:\n","\n","```python\n","def count_up_to(n):\n","    count = 1\n","    while count <= n:\n","        yield count\n","        count += 1\n","\n","# Using the generator\n","counter = count_up_to(5)\n","print(next(counter))  # Output: 1\n","print(next(counter))  # Output: 2\n","```\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **3. `yield` vs `return`**\n","\n","- **`return`**: Exits the function and returns a value. You cannot call the function again to continue from where it left off.\n","- **`yield`**: Pauses the function and returns a value. The function can be resumed later from the same point.\n","\n","#### **Example to Compare `yield` and `return`**:\n","\n","```python\n","def simple_return():\n","    return 1\n","    return 2  # This line won't execute\n","\n","def simple_yield():\n","    yield 1\n","    yield 2  # This line will execute in the next call\n","```\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **4. Iterating Over Generators**\n","\n","- Generators can be iterated using **`for` loops** or **`next()`** function.\n","- Once all items have been generated, the generator is **exhausted**, and `StopIteration` is raised.\n","\n","#### **Example**:\n","\n","```python\n","def simple_generator():\n","    yield 'Hello'\n","    yield 'World'\n","\n","for word in simple_generator():\n","    print(word)\n","```\n","\n","**Output**:\n","```\n","Hello\n","World\n","```\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **5. Generator Expressions (Like List Comprehensions)**\n","\n","- **Generator expressions** are similar to list comprehensions but with parentheses `()` instead of square brackets `[]`.\n","- They are also memory efficient because they do not store all the values in memory.\n","\n","#### **Example**:\n","\n","```python\n","squares = (x * x for x in range(5))\n","for square in squares:\n","    print(square)\n","```\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **6. Use Cases for Generators**\n","\n","- **Lazy Evaluation**: Generators are perfect when you donâ€™t need all the values at once.\n","- **Memory Efficiency**: For very large datasets, they save memory by yielding one item at a time.\n","- **Infinite Sequences**: Generators can represent infinite sequences, which would be impossible with lists.\n","\n","---\n","\n","#### **Example: Infinite Sequence Generator**\n","\n","```python\n","def infinite_count():\n","    num = 0\n","    while True:\n","        yield num\n","        num += 1\n","```\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **7. Comparison: List vs Generator**\n","\n","| **List**                     | **Generator**                     |\n","|-------------------------------|------------------------------------|\n","| Stores all items in memory     | Generates items on the fly        |\n","| Requires more memory for large datasets | Memory-efficient for large or infinite datasets |\n","| Access items by index          | Must iterate to access items      |\n","\n","#### **Example**:\n","\n","```python\n","# List (stores all values)\n","squares_list = [x * x for x in range(1000)]  # Consumes more memory\n","\n","# Generator (produces one value at a time)\n","squares_gen = (x * x for x in range(1000))  # Memory-efficient\n","```\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **8. Generators with `next()`**\n","\n","- **`next()`** is used to manually retrieve values from a generator.\n","\n","#### **Example**:\n","\n","```python\n","gen = (x * x for x in range(3))\n","print(next(gen))  # Output: 0\n","print(next(gen))  # Output: 1\n","print(next(gen))  # Output: 4\n","```\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **9. Why Use Generators?**\n","\n","- **Efficiency**: Generate large or infinite sequences without hogging memory.\n","- **On-Demand Computation**: Values are generated only when needed.\n","- **Pipeline Processing**: You can chain generators to process data in stages.\n","\n","#### **Example Scenario**:\n","You can use a generator for processing log files line by line in a large dataset, instead of loading the entire file into memory at once.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **Summary**:\n","\n","- **Generators** allow you to produce values lazily (on demand) instead of holding them in memory.\n","- They are defined using `yield` and are ideal for large datasets and infinite sequences.\n","- **Generator expressions** offer a concise and memory-efficient way to create generators, similar to list comprehensions.\n","\n","---\n"],"metadata":{"id":"T067TTAoqDC7"}}]}
