It can define functions, classes, and variables, and include runnable code.\n","- **Purpose**: Modules help organize code into manageable sections. They allow you to reuse code across different programs.\n","\n","**How to Use Modules:**\n","1. **Importing a Module**: You use the `import` statement to bring a module into your script.\n","   ```python\n","   import module_name\n","   ```\n","   Example:\n","   ```python\n","   import math\n","   print(math.sqrt(16))  # Outputs: 4.0\n","   ```\n","2. **Importing Specific Items**: You can also import specific functions or classes from a module.\n","   ```python\n","   from module_name import item_name\n","   ```\n","   Example:\n","   ```python\n","   from math import sqrt\n","   print(sqrt(16))  # Outputs: 4.0\n","   ```\n","3. **Creating Your Own Module**: Save your Python code in a file with a `.py` extension, e.g., `my_module.py`.\n","   ```python\n","   # my_module.py\n","   def greet(name):\n","       return f\"Hello, {name}!\"\n","   ```\n","   Then, you can use it in another script:\n","   ```python\n","   import my_module\n","   print(my_module.greet(\"Alice\"))  # Outputs: Hello, Alice!\n","   ```\n","\n","### **Exception Handling**\n","\n","**What is Exception Handling?**\n","- **Definition**: Exception handling allows you to manage errors that occur during the execution of your program. Instead of crashing, the program can handle errors gracefully.\n","\n","**Key Components:**\n","1. **Try Block**: Code that might cause an exception is put inside a `try` block.\n","   ```python\n","   try:\n","       # Code that may raise an exception\n","   ```\n","2. **Except Block**: Code that handles the exception if one occurs.\n","   ```python\n","   except ExceptionType as e:\n","       # Code that runs if an exception occurs\n","   ```\n","   Example:\n","   ```python\n","   try:\n","       x = 1 / 0\n","   except ZeroDivisionError:\n","       print(\"You can't divide by zero!\")\n","   ```\n","3. **Finally Block**: Code that runs no matter what, whether or not an exception occurs.\n","   ```python\n","   finally:\n","       # Code that always runs\n","   ```\n","   Example:\n","   ```python\n","   try:\n","       file = open(\"example.txt\", \"r\")\n","   except FileNotFoundError:\n","       print(\"File not found.\")\n","   finally:\n","       file.close()\n","   ```\n","\n","4. **Else Block**: Code that runs if no exception occurs.\n","   ```python\n","   else:\n","       # Code that runs if no exception occurs\n","   ```\n"," user enters non-numeric input.\n","   - `ZeroDivisionError` if the user tries to divide by zero.\n","3. Ensure that appropriate messages are displayed for each type of exception.\n","\n","Feel free to reach out if you need any clarifications or further help with the assignments!"],"metadata":{"id":"WiwFcnl5HO3B"}}]}
