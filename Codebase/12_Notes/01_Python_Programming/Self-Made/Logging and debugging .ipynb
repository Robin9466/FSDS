It helps track what the program is doing and makes it easier to identify issues.\n","\n","#### 2. **Why Use Logging?**\n","- **Debugging:** Understand what went wrong in your code.\n","- **Monitoring:** Keep track of what your code is doing in production.\n","- **Auditing:** Record important events, like user actions.\n","\n","#### 3. **Basic Logging in Python**\n","Python has a built-in module called `logging`. Here’s a simple example:\n","\n","```python\n","import logging\n","\n","# Set up basic configuration for logging\n","logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)\n","\n","# Log some messages\n","logging.debug(\"This is a debug message\")    # Detailed information, typically for diagnosing problems\n","logging.info(\"This is an info message\")     # Confirmation that things are working as expected\n","logging.warning(\"This is a warning message\")# An indication that something unexpected happened\n","logging.error(\"This is an error message\")   # A more serious problem, the program may not be able to continue\n","logging.critical(\"This is a critical message\") # A very serious problem, the program itself may be unable to continue\n","```\n","\n","- **Output:**  \n","  ```\n","  INFO:root:This is an info message\n","  WARNING:root:This is a warning message\n","  ERROR:root:This is an error message\n","  CRITICAL:root:This is a critical message\n","  ```\n","- Note: `logging.debug` won't show up because the default level is `INFO`.\n","\n","#### 4. **Log Levels Explained:**\n","- **DEBUG:** Detailed information, useful during development.\n","- **INFO:** General information about program execution.\n","- **WARNING:** An indication of something that might be a problem.\n","- **ERROR:** A problem that caused a function or part of the code to fail.\n","- **CRITICAL:** A serious error indicating the program may not be able to continue.\n","\n","### Debugging in Python\n","\n","#### 1. **What is Debugging?**\n","Debugging is the process of finding and fixing errors or bugs in your code.\n","\n","#### 2. **Common Debugging Techniques:**\n","- **Print Statements:** Adding `print()` to see what your code is doing.\n","- **Using a Debugger:** Tools like `pdb` (Python Debugger) to pause and inspect the code step-by-step.\n","- **Exception Handling:** Using `try` and `except` blocks to catch and handle errors gracefully.\n","\n","#### 3. **Basic Debugging with `pdb`:**\n","```python\n","import pdb\n","\n","def add(a, b):\n","    pdb.set_trace()  # This will pause the code here\n","    return a + b\n","\n","result = add(3, 5)\n","print(result)\n","```\n","\n","- When you run this, the program will pause at `pdb.set_trace()`, and you can inspect variables and step through the code.\n","\n","#### 4. **Common Debugging Commands:**\n","- **`n` (next):** Execute the next line of code.\n","- **`s` (step):** Step into a function call.\n","- **`c` (continue):** Continue execution until the next breakpoint.\n","- **`q` (quit):** Quit the debugger.\n","\n","### Summary\n","- **Logging** helps record the flow and errors in a program, making it easier to debug later.\n","- **Debugging** is actively identifying and fixing issues in your code using tools like print statements and debuggers.\n","\n","\n","Great! Let's dive into more advanced logging and debugging techniques to enhance your understanding and skills.\n","\n","### Advanced Logging in Python\n","\n","#### 1. **Log Formatting:**\n","You can customize the format of your log messages to include more context, like the time, module name, and line number.\n","\n","```python\n","import logging\n","\n","logging.basicConfig(\n","    level=logging.DEBUG,\n","    format='%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s'\n",")\n","\n","logging.debug(\"This is a debug message\")\n","```\n","\n","**Output:**\n","```\n","2024-09-19 12:34:56,789 - root - DEBUG - This is a debug message\n","```\n","**Explanation:**\n","- `%(asctime)s`: Timestamp of the log entry.\n","- `%(name)s`: Name of the logger.\n","- `%(levelname)s`: Log level (e.g., DEBUG, INFO).\n","- `%(message)s`: The log message.\n","\n","#### 2. **Creating and Using Loggers:**\n","Instead of using the root logger, you can create separate loggers for different modules or components of your application.\n","\n","```python\n","import logging\n","\n","# Create a custom logger\n","logger = logging.getLogger('my_logger')\n","\n","# Set the log level\n","logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)\n","\n","# Create handlers\n","console_handler = logging.StreamHandler()\n","file_handler = logging.FileHandler('app.log')\n","\n","# Create formatters and add them to handlers\n","formatter = logging.Formatter('%(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')\n","console_handler.setFormatter(formatter)\n","file_handler.setFormatter(formatter)\n","\n","# Add handlers to the logger\n","logger.addHandler(console_handler)\n","logger.addHandler(file_handler)\n","\n","# Log messages\n","logger.info(\"This will appear on console and in the file\")\n","logger.debug(\"This is a debug message\")\n","```\n","\n","**Explanation:**\n","- **Logger:** Allows you to create named loggers, making it easier to identify the source of log messages.\n","- **Handlers:** Define where to send the log messages (console, file, etc.).\n","- **Formatter:** Defines the layout of the log message.\n","\n","#### 3. **Rotating Log Files:**\n","Use `RotatingFileHandler` to manage log file sizes automatically.\n","\n","```python\n","from logging.handlers import RotatingFileHandler\n","\n","# Create a handler that rotates log files when they reach 1MB, keeping 3 backups\n","handler = RotatingFileHandler('app.log', maxBytes=1_000_000, backupCount=3)\n","logger.addHandler(handler)\n","```\n","- **maxBytes:** Maximum file size before rotating.\n","- **backupCount:** Number of old log files to keep.\n","\n","#### 4. **Logging Exceptions:**\n","You can log exceptions along with the stack trace.\n","\n","```python\n","try:\n","    1 / 0\n","except ZeroDivisionError:\n","    logger.exception(\"An error occurred\")\n","```\n","\n","**Output:**\n","```\n","my_logger - ERROR - An error occurred\n","Traceback (most recent call last):\n","  File \"<stdin>\", line 2, in <module>\n","ZeroDivisionError: division by zero\n","```\n","\n","### Advanced Debugging in Python\n","\n","#### 1. **Using Breakpoints in IDEs:**\n","Modern IDEs like PyCharm, VS Code, or Jupyter notebooks have integrated debugging tools. You can set breakpoints by clicking on the line number, allowing you to pause and inspect variables.\n","\n","#### 2. **Conditional Breakpoints:**\n","Breakpoints that trigger only when a specific condition is met.\n","\n","```python\n","import pdb\n","\n","def check_number(n):\n","    if n > 5:\n","        pdb.set_trace()  # Only pause if condition is met\n","    print(f\"Number: {n}\")\n","\n","check_number(10)\n","```\n","**Explanation:**\n","The debugger will pause only if `n > 5`.\n","\n","#### 3. **Debugging Using `pdb` Commands:**\n","- **`l` (list):** Show the source code around the current line.\n","- **`p variable_name`:** Print the value of a variable.\n","- **`! command`:** Execute a Python command in the current context.\n","\n","#### 4. **Debugging with `ipdb`:**\n","`ipdb` is an enhanced version of `pdb` with better user experience and features like syntax highlighting.\n","\n","```bash\n","pip install ipdb\n","```\n","\n","Then, use it similarly to `pdb`:\n","\n","```python\n","import ipdb\n","ipdb.set_trace()\n","```\n","\n","### Next Steps\n","\n","If you’re comfortable with these concepts, let me know. I’ll provide assignments focusing on:\n","1. Creating loggers and using them in a modular application.\n","2. Implementing log rotation.\n","3. Debugging exercises using `pdb` and `ipdb`.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"jNEwQOyNrUtD"}}]}
