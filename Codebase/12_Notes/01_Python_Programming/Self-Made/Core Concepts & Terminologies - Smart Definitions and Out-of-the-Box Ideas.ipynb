It uses symbols and arrows to show the steps of a task and the decisions to be made. Think of it as a roadmap for how to solve a problem.\n","\n","#### Example:\n","If you want to check if a number is **even** or **odd**, the flowchart might look like this:\n","\n","```\n","[Start] → [Input number] → [Is the number divisible by 2?]\n","                            ↓Yes                      ↓No\n","                          [Even]                  [Odd]\n","                            ↓                         ↓\n","                         [End]                    [End]\n","```\n","\n","In this visual:\n","- Rectangles show tasks (e.g., input number).\n","- Diamonds show decisions (e.g., is the number divisible by 2?).\n","- Arrows show the flow of the process.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### 2. **Pseudocode**\n","**Pseudocode** is a way to write down how a program will work using plain language. It’s not actual code, but a simple version of it that explains the steps clearly.\n","\n","#### Example:\n","Let’s say you want to **find the largest of two numbers**:\n","\n","**Pseudocode**:\n","1. Start\n","2. Input two numbers, A and B\n","3. If A is greater than B, print \"A is larger\"\n","4. Else, print \"B is larger\"\n","5. End\n","\n","This is a straightforward, human-readable explanation of what the program will do. It's like a rough draft before writing real code.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### 3. **Algorithm**\n","An **algorithm** is just a list of steps that tell you how to solve a problem. Think of it like a recipe: it tells you what to do step by step.\n","\n","#### Example:\n","Let’s make an **algorithm** for making a sandwich:\n","\n","1. Take two slices of bread.\n","2. Spread butter on one slice.\n","3. Put a slice of cheese on top of the butter.\n","4. Add another slice of bread on top.\n","5. Your sandwich is ready to eat!\n","\n","An algorithm for finding the largest of two numbers would be:\n","\n","1. Start.\n","2. Input two numbers.\n","3. Compare the two numbers.\n","4. If the first number is greater, that’s the largest.\n","5. If the second number is greater, that’s the largest.\n","6. End.\n","\n","Algorithms can be written in simple language or with code, depending on who’s using them.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### Visual Representations\n","\n","#### Flowchart Example:\n","Here's a **flowchart** for checking if a number is positive or negative:\n","\n","```\n","[Start] → [Input number] → [Is the number > 0?]\n","                            ↓Yes                      ↓No\n","                        [Positive]               [Negative]\n","                            ↓                         ↓\n","                         [End]                    [End]\n","```\n","\n","#### Pseudocode Example:\n","Here’s how you might write pseudocode to check if a number is positive or negative:\n","\n","1. Start\n","2. Input a number\n","3. If the number is greater than 0, print \"Positive\"\n","4. Else, print \"Negative\"\n","5. End\n","\n","#### Algorithm Example:\n","For checking if a number is positive or negative:\n","\n","1. Start\n","2. Input a number\n","3. Check if the number is greater than 0\n","4. If true, it's positive; if false, it's negative\n","5. End\n","\n","---\n","\n","By using flowcharts, pseudocode, and algorithms, you can **plan your logic** clearly before diving into writing code! These are all useful tools to think through a problem step by step.\n","\n","Video tutorial for Flow of Program - Flowcharts & Pseudocode:\n","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhELGQAV4gg&pp=ygU9VmlkZW8gdHV0b3JpYWwgZm9yIEZsb3cgb2YgUHJvZ3JhbSAtIEZsb3djaGFydHMgJiBQc2V1ZG9jb2RlOg%3D%3D\n","\n","\n","\n","**Metadata** is data that describes other data. It provides context or additional information about the content of a file, document, or dataset, making it easier to find, use, and manage that data.\n","\n","### Key Points:\n","1. **Definition**: Metadata is essentially \"data about data.\"\n","2. **Examples**:\n","   - In a photo: Metadata includes information like the date the photo was taken, the camera used, and the location.\n","   - In a document: Metadata may include the author, date of creation, and last modified time.\n","3. **Types of Metadata**:\n","   - **Descriptive**: Information about the content (e.g., title, author, keywords).\n","   - **Structural**: Information about how the data is organized (e.g., chapters in a book).\n","   - **Administrative**: Technical details like file type, size, or creation date.\n","4. **Uses**: Metadata helps in organizing, searching, and sorting data efficiently. For instance, search engines use metadata to rank web pages.\n","\n","In summary, metadata adds value by making it easier to manage, retrieve, and understand data.\n","\n","### 1. **What is a Method?**\n","\n","A **method** is a function that is associated with an **object** and can access or modify the object's data. In Python, methods are called on an object using **dot notation**. Methods are similar to functions, but they are always **bound to an object**.\n","\n","For example:\n","- When you do `my_list.append(4)`, you are calling the `append()` method on the list `my_list`.\n","- The list (`my_list`) is the object, and `append()` is the method that modifies the list.\n","\n","### Key Points:\n","- **Function**: A block of reusable code that performs a specific task. It can be used independently.\n","  - Example: `len([1, 2, 3])` is a function that returns the length of the list.\n","  \n","- **Method**: A function that belongs to an **object** and is called on that object using dot notation.\n","  - Example: `my_list.append(4)` is a method that modifies `my_list` by adding `4` to it.\n","\n","### 2. **Why use dot notation (`.`) for methods like `append()`?**\n","- When you use a method like `my_list.append(4)`, you are telling Python, “Call the `append()` method on this specific list object (`my_list`)”.\n","- Python methods are **attached** to objects like lists, strings, or dictionaries, and they modify or retrieve data directly from that object.\n","\n","### Example:\n","```python\n","my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n","\n","# Call the append method on my_list to add an item\n","my_list.append(4)\n","print(my_list)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4]\n","```\n","\n","Here, `my_list` is the object, and `append()` is the method that operates on that list object.\n","\n","### 3. **Differences between Functions and Methods:**\n","\n","| **Aspect**        | **Functions**                              | **Methods**                                     |\n","|-------------------|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|\n","| **Called by**     | Using the function name (`function()`)      | Using dot notation (`object.method()`)          |\n","| **Belongs to**    | Independent, can be used anywhere           | Belongs to an object (e.g., list, string)       |\n","| **Example**       | `len(my_list)` (function)                   | `my_list.append(4)` (method)                    |\n","| **Purpose**       | Performs a task, returns a value            | Performs a task related to the object           |\n","\n","### 4. **Example of Method vs Function**:\n","Here’s an example of a method (`append()`) versus a function (`len()`):\n","\n","```python\n","my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n","\n","# Method: modifies the list by appending 4\n","my_list.append(4)  \n","print(my_list)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4]\n","\n","# Function: calculates the length of the list\n","length = len(my_list)\n","print(length)  # Output: 4\n","```\n","\n","- `append()` is a **method** called on the list `my_list`.\n","- `len()` is a **function** that calculates the length of the list, not bound to an object.\n","\n","### Conclusion:\n","- **Methods** are special functions attached to objects (like lists, strings, etc.), and are called using **dot notation**.\n","- The key difference between a method and a function is that a method operates on the object it is called on, while a function can work independently.\n","\n","\n","\n","A **programming language** is a system of rules and syntax used to write instructions that a computer can understand and execute. These instructions are called \"programs\" or \"code,\" and they tell the computer what tasks to perform.\n","\n","In simpler terms, a programming language is like a set of commands that helps you talk to a computer. Just as we use language to communicate with each other, we use programming languages to communicate with computers.\n","\n","For example, if you want a computer to add two numbers, you would write a simple program in a programming language to tell it to do that.\n","\n","\n","\n","Here are the main types of programming languages, explained simply:\n","\n","1. **Procedural Languages**:\n","   - **What It Does**: Tells the computer what to do step by step.\n","   - **Example**: **C** – Like giving a list of instructions to follow one by one.\n","\n","2. **Object-Oriented Languages**:\n","   - **What It Does**: Organizes code into “objects” that have data and actions.\n","   - **Example**: **Java** – Like creating a set of tools where each tool has its own job and information.\n","\n","3. **Functional Languages**:\n","   - **What It Does**: Focuses on using functions to solve problems.\n","   - **Example**: **Haskell** – Like solving math problems by using formulas.\n","\n","4. **Logical Languages**:\n","   - **What It Does**: Uses logic and rules to solve problems.\n","   - **Example**: **Prolog** – Like solving puzzles using clues and rules.\n","\n","5. **Scripting Languages**:\n","   - **What It Does**: Automates tasks and writes short programs to do specific jobs.\n","   - **Example**: **Python** – Like writing quick scripts to handle repetitive tasks.\n","\n","6. **Markup Languages**:\n","   - **What It Does**: Formats and structures text.\n","   - **Example**: **HTML** – Like setting up the layout of a web page.\n","\n","7. **Domain-Specific Languages**:\n","   - **What It Does**: Specializes in a particular area or task.\n","   - **Example**: **SQL** – Like a special tool for working with databases."],"metadata":{"id":"bxl3eAR5nQKp"}}]}
