Functions in Python**\n","\n","---\n","\n","#### **Definition**:\n","- A **function** in Python is a block of reusable code that performs a specific task. It helps organize the code, making it more readable, maintainable, and efficient.\n","\n","---\n","\n","#### **Basic Function Structure**:\n","\n","A function in Python has the following structure:\n","\n","```python\n","def function_name(parameters):\n","    # Function body\n","    return value  # (optional)\n","```\n","\n","#### **Example**:\n","\n","```python\n","def greet(name):\n","    return f\"Hello, {name}!\"\n","```\n","\n","---\n","\n","#### **Parameters and Arguments**:\n","\n","- **Parameters** are the variables defined in the function.\n","- **Arguments** are the values passed to the function when it is called.\n","\n","**Example**:\n","\n","```python\n","def add(a, b):  # a and b are parameters\n","    return a + b\n","\n","result = add(5, 3)  # 5 and 3 are arguments\n","```\n","\n","---\n","\n","#### **Return Statement**:\n","- A function can optionally return a value using the `return` statement. If no value is returned, the function returns `None` by default.\n","\n","**Example**:\n","\n","```python\n","def multiply(a, b):\n","    return a * b\n","\n","print(multiply(2, 4))  # Output: 8\n","```\n","\n","---\n","\n","#### **Types of Functions**:\n","\n","- **User-defined Functions**: Functions created by users.\n","- **Built-in Functions**: Predefined functions provided by Python, e.g., `print()`, `len()`.\n","- **Anonymous Functions (Lambda Functions)**: Functions that don't have a name, often used for short, simple operations.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **2. Lambda Functions (Anonymous Functions)**\n","\n","#### **Definition**:\n","- A **lambda function** is a small, anonymous function defined using the keyword `lambda`. It can have any number of arguments but only one expression.\n","\n","---\n","\n","#### **Syntax**:\n","\n","```python\n","lambda arguments: expression\n","```\n","\n","---\n","\n","#### **Example**:\n","\n","```python\n","square = lambda x: x * x\n","print(square(5))  # Output: 25\n","```\n","\n","**Analogy**: A lambda function is like a \"one-liner\" that can perform simple tasks quickly, without needing to define a full function.\n","\n","#### **Use Case**:\n","- Lambda functions are useful in scenarios like filtering, mapping, and reducing data.\n","\n","**Example with `filter()`**:\n","\n","```python\n","numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\n","even_numbers = list(filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, numbers))\n","print(even_numbers)  # Output: [2, 4, 6]\n","```\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **3. Function Types Based on Parameters**:\n","\n","#### **a. Default Parameters**:\n","\n","- Functions can have default values for parameters.\n","\n","**Example**:\n","\n","```python\n","def greet(name=\"Guest\"):\n","    return f\"Hello, {name}!\"\n","    \n","print(greet())        # Output: Hello, Guest!\n","print(greet(\"John\"))  # Output: Hello, John!\n","```\n","\n","---\n","\n","#### **b. Variable-Length Arguments**:\n","\n","- Sometimes, you don't know how many arguments a function needs to accept. Python provides two ways to handle this:\n","  - **`*args`**: Allows the function to take in a variable number of positional arguments.\n","  - **`**kwargs`**: Allows the function to take in a variable number of keyword arguments.\n","\n","**Example (`*args`)**:\n","\n","```python\n","def add(*numbers):\n","    return sum(numbers)\n","\n","print(add(1, 2, 3))  # Output: 6\n","```\n","\n","**Example (`**kwargs`)**:\n","\n","```python\n","def introduce(**info):\n","    return f\"Name: {info['name']}, Age: {info['age']}\"\n","\n","print(introduce(name=\"John\", age=25))  # Output: Name: John, Age: 25\n","```\n","\n","Let me simplify the concept of `**kwargs` for you.\n","\n","- `**kwargs` allows a function to accept a **variable number of keyword arguments**. Keyword arguments are like **name-value pairs**, where you provide both the key (name) and its associated value.\n","\n","### Key Points:\n","- **Keyword arguments** are passed using a key (like \"name\") and a value (like \"John\").\n","- You can pass as many keyword arguments as you want.\n","- The function can then access these keyword arguments using the keys you provided.\n","\n","### Simplified Example:\n","\n","```python\n","def introduce(**info):\n","    return f\"Name: {info['name']}, Age: {info['age']}\"\n","\n","# When calling the function, you can pass multiple keyword arguments\n","print(introduce(name=\"John\", age=25))  \n","# Output: \"Name: John, Age: 25\"\n","```\n","\n","In this example:\n","- The function accepts **any number of keyword arguments** using `**info`.\n","- Inside the function, you can access values like `info['name']` and `info['age']`.\n","\n","Does this help clarify the meaning?\n","---\n","\n","### **4. Function Scope**\n","\n","#### **Local Scope**:\n","- Variables declared inside a function are local to that function and cannot be accessed outside.\n","\n","**Example**:\n","\n","```python\n","def my_function():\n","    x = 10  # Local variable\n","    print(x)\n","    \n","my_function()  # Output: 10\n","# print(x)  # Error: x is not defined\n","```\n","\n","#### **Global Scope**:\n","- Variables declared outside all functions can be accessed globally.\n","\n","**Example**:\n","\n","```python\n","x = 20  # Global variable\n","\n","def my_function():\n","    print(x)\n","    \n","my_function()  # Output: 20\n","```\n","\n","#### **Global Keyword**:\n","- If you need to modify a global variable inside a function, use the `global` keyword.\n","\n","**Example**:\n","\n","```python\n","x = 20\n","\n","def modify():\n","    global x\n","    x = 30\n","\n","modify()\n","print(x)  # Output: 30\n","```\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **5. Nested Functions and Closures**\n","\n","#### **Nested Functions**:\n","- A function inside another function.\n","\n","**Example**:\n","\n","```python\n","def outer_function():\n","    def inner_function():\n","        return \"Hello from the inner function!\"\n","    return inner_function()\n","\n","print(outer_function())  # Output: Hello from the inner function!\n","```\n","\n","#### **Closure**:\n","- A closure is a function that remembers the environment in which it was created, even after the outer function has finished executing.\n","\n","**Example**:\n","\n","```python\n","def outer(x):\n","    def inner(y):\n","        return x + y\n","    return inner\n","\n","add_5 = outer(5)\n","print(add_5(10))  # Output: 15\n","```\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **6. Recursion**\n","\n","#### **Definition**:\n","- A function that calls itself.\n","\n","#### **Example**:\n","\n","```python\n","def factorial(n):\n","    if n == 1:\n","        return 1\n","    else:\n","        return n * factorial(n-1)\n","\n","print(factorial(5))  # Output: 120\n","```\n","\n","**Scenario**:\n","Recursion is helpful in problems like calculating factorials, traversing tree structures, or solving complex mathematical problems.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **7. Higher-Order Functions**\n","\n","#### **Definition**:\n","- A function that takes another function as an argument or returns a function.\n","\n","**Example**:\n","\n","```python\n","def apply_function(func, value):\n","    return func(value)\n","\n","print(apply_function(lambda x: x * 2, 5))  # Output: 10\n","```\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **8. Function Annotations**\n","\n","#### **Definition**:\n","- You can provide metadata about the parameters and return type of a function using annotations.\n","\n","**Example**:\n","\n","```python\n","def greet(name: str) -> str:\n","    return f\"Hello, {name}!\"\n","```\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **9. Practical Scenarios for Functions**\n","\n","- **Reusability**: Define functions once and use them throughout the code.\n","- **Modularity**: Break a complex task into simpler, manageable pieces using functions.\n","- **Debugging**: Isolate bugs easily by testing functions individually.\n","- **Enhancements**: You can easily enhance functions by modifying them without affecting the rest of the code.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **Summary**:\n","\n","- **Functions** help you create organized, reusable, and modular code.\n","- **Lambda functions** provide a quick way to create small, one-time-use functions.\n","- **Scope** and **closures** ensure data is handled efficiently.\n","- **Recursion** and **higher-order functions** are powerful techniques for solving complex problems.\n","  \n","---\n","\n","Hereâ€™s a concise, structured summary of all 10 Python built-in functions, complete with simple explanations, syntaxes, and examples, designed for easy review and practice.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### 1. **`map()`**\n","- **What it does**: Applies a function to each item in an iterable (e.g., list) and returns a new iterable with the results.\n","- **Syntax**: `map(function, iterable)`\n","- **Example**:\n","   ```python\n","   numbers = [1, 2, 3]\n","   squares = map(lambda x: x**2, numbers)\n","   print(list(squares))  #
