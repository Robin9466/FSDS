Hereâ€™s a guide to common naming conventions in Python:\n","\n","### 1. Variable Names\n","- **Style**: Use lowercase letters with words separated by underscores.\n","- **Example**: `total_price`, `user_name`\n","\n","### 2. Function Names\n","- **Style**: Similar to variable names, use lowercase with underscores separating words.\n","- **Example**: `calculate_area()`, `send_email()`\n","\n","### 3. Class Names\n","- **Style**: Use PascalCase (also known as CamelCase), where each word starts with a capital letter.\n","- **Example**: `CarModel`, `EmployeeDetails`\n","\n","### 4. Constant Names\n","- **Style**: Use all uppercase letters with words separated by underscores.\n","- **Example**: `MAX_SPEED`, `PI`\n","\n","### 5. Private Variables or Functions\n","- **Style**: Start with a single underscore (`_`) to indicate internal use.\n","- **Example**: `_private_method()`, `_internal_data`\n","\n","### 6. Magic Methods\n","- **Style**: Special methods surrounded by double underscores (also known as \"dunder\" methods).\n","- **Example**: `__init__()`, `__str__()`\n","\n","### Key Guidelines\n","- **Descriptive but Concise**: Choose names that convey purpose while remaining concise.\n","  - **Good**: `calculate_total`, `num_students`\n","  - **Bad**: `x`, `temp`\n","  \n","- **Avoid Single-Letter Names**: Use them sparingly, typically in small loops (e.g., `for i in range()`).\n","\n","By adhering to these conventions, you ensure your Python code is understandable and aligned with community standards, enhancing collaboration and maintainability.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### Review Questions:\n","1.
