Functions in Python**\n","\n","---\n","\n","#### **Definition**:\n","- A **function** in Python is a block of reusable code that performs a specific task. It helps organize the code, making it more readable, maintainable, and efficient.\n","\n","---\n","\n","#### **Basic Function Structure**:\n","A function in Python has the following structure:\n","\n","```python\n","def function_name(parameters):\n","    # Function body\n","    return value  # (optional)\n","```\n","\n","#### **Example**:\n","\n","```python\n","def greet(name):\n","    return f\"Hello, {name}!\"\n","```\n","\n","---\n","\n","#### **Parameters and Arguments**:\n","- **Parameters** are the variables defined in the function.\n","- **Arguments** are the values passed to the function when it is called.\n","\n","**Example**:\n","\n","```python\n","def add(a, b):  # a and b are parameters\n","    return a + b\n","\n","result = add(5, 3)  # 5 and 3 are arguments\n","```\n","\n","---\n","\n","#### **Return Statement**:\n","- A function can optionally return a value using the `return` statement. If no value is returned, the function returns `None` by default.\n","\n","**Example**:\n","\n","```python\n","def multiply(a, b):\n","    return a * b\n","\n","print(multiply(2, 4))  # Output: 8\n","```\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **Key Function Concepts**:\n","\n","#### **1. Function Signature**:\n","- Refers to the part of the function definition that specifies:\n","  - The function's name.\n","  - The parameters it accepts.\n","\n","**Example**:\n","```python\n","def add_numbers(a, b):\n","    return a + b\n","```\n","- Here, the function signature is `add_numbers(a, b)`.\n","\n","#### **2. Function Definition**:\n","- Includes the function signature and the body of the function.\n","\n","**Example**:\n","```python\n","def add_numbers(a, b):\n","    return a + b\n","```\n","\n","#### **3. Parameters**:\n","- Inputs that you pass into a function.\n","\n","**Example**:\n","In `add_numbers(a, b)`, `a` and `b` are parameters.\n","\n","#### **4. Arguments**:\n","- Actual values passed to the function when calling it.\n","\n","**Example**:\n","```python\n","result = add_numbers(3, 5)  # 3 and 5 are arguments\n","```\n","\n","#### **5. Return Value**:\n","- The output of a function, specified using the `return` statement.\n","\n","**Example**:\n","```python\n","def add_numbers(a, b):\n","    return a + b\n","```\n","- The return value is the sum of `a` and `b`.\n","\n","#### **6. Function Call**:\n","- Executing a function using its name and parentheses.\n","\n","**Example**:\n","```python\n","result = add_numbers(3, 5)  # This calls the function\n","```\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **Types of Functions**:\n","\n","- **User-defined Functions**: Created by users.\n","- **Built-in Functions**: Predefined functions provided by Python (e.g., `print()`, `len()`).\n","- **Anonymous Functions (Lambda Functions)**: Functions without names, used for short operations.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **2. Lambda Functions (Anonymous Functions)**\n","\n","#### **Definition**:\n","- A **lambda function** is a small, anonymous function defined using the keyword `lambda`. It can have any number of arguments but only one expression.\n","\n","#### **Syntax**:\n","\n","```python\n","lambda arguments: expression\n","```\n","\n","#### **Example**:\n","\n","```python\n","square = lambda x: x * x\n","print(square(5))  # Output: 25\n","```\n","\n","**Analogy**: A lambda function is like a \"one-liner\" that performs simple tasks quickly.\n","\n","#### **Use Case**:\n","- Useful in filtering, mapping, and reducing data.\n","\n","**Example with `filter()`**:\n","\n","```python\n","numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\n","even_numbers = list(filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, numbers))\n","print(even_numbers)  # Output: [2, 4, 6]\n","```\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **3. Function Types Based on Parameters**:\n","\n","#### **a. Default Parameters**:\n","- Functions can have default values for parameters.\n","\n","**Example**:\n","\n","```python\n","def greet(name=\"Guest\"):\n","    return f\"Hello, {name}!\"\n","\n","print(greet())        # Output: Hello, Guest!\n","print(greet(\"John\"))  # Output: Hello, John!\n","```\n","\n","---\n","\n","#### **b. Variable-Length Arguments**:\n","- Python allows functions to accept a variable number of arguments:\n","  - **`*args`**: Accepts variable positional arguments.\n","  - **`**kwargs`**: Accepts variable keyword arguments.\n","\n","**Example (`*args`)**:\n","\n","```python\n","def add(*numbers):\n","    return sum(numbers)\n","\n","print(add(1, 2, 3))  # Output: 6\n","```\n","\n","**Example (`**kwargs`)**:\n","\n","```python\n","def introduce(**info):\n","    return f\"Name: {info['name']}, Age: {info['age']}\"\n","\n","print(introduce(name=\"John\", age=25))  # Output: Name: John, Age: 25\n","```\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **4. Function Scope**:\n","\n","#### **Local Scope**:\n","- Variables declared inside a function are local and inaccessible outside.\n","\n","**Example**:\n","\n","```python\n","def my_function():\n","    x = 10  # Local variable\n","    print(x)\n","\n","my_function()  # Output: 10\n","# print(x)  # Error: x is not defined\n","```\n","\n","#### **Global Scope**:\n","- Variables declared outside functions are accessible globally.\n","\n","**Example**:\n","\n","```python\n","x = 20  # Global variable\n","\n","def my_function():\n","    print(x)\n","\n","my_function()  # Output: 20\n","```\n","\n","#### **Global Keyword**:\n","- Use the `global` keyword to modify a global variable inside a function.\n","\n","**Example**:\n","\n","```python\n","x = 20\n","\n","def modify():\n","    global x\n","    x = 30\n","\n","modify()\n","print(x)  # Output: 30\n","```\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **5. Nested Functions and Closures**:\n","\n","#### **Nested Functions**:\n","- A function defined within another function.\n","\n","**Example**:\n","\n","```python\n","def outer_function():\n","    def inner_function():\n","        return \"Hello from the inner function!\"\n","    return inner_function()\n","\n","print(outer_function())  # Output: Hello from the inner function!\n","```\n","\n","#### **Closure**:\n","- A function that remembers its environment even after the outer function has finished executing.\n","\n","**Example**:\n","\n","```python\n","def outer(x):\n","    def inner(y):\n","        return x + y\n","    return inner\n","\n","add_5 = outer(5)\n","print(add_5(10))  # Output: 15\n","```\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **6. Recursion**:\n","\n","#### **Definition**:\n","- A function that calls itself.\n","\n","#### **Example**:\n","\n","```python\n","def factorial(n):\n","    if n == 1:\n","        return 1\n","    else:\n","        return n * factorial(n-1)\n","\n","print(factorial(5))  # Output: 120\n","```\n","\n","**Scenario**: Recursion is useful for calculating factorials, traversing trees, and solving complex problems.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **7. Higher-Order Functions**:\n","\n","#### **Definition**:\n","- A function that takes another function as an argument or returns a function.\n","\n","**Example**:\n","\n","```python\n","def apply_function(func, value):\n","    return func(value)\n","\n","print(apply_function(lambda x: x * 2, 5))  # Output: 10\n","```\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **8. Function Annotations**:\n","\n","#### **Definition**:\n","- Provide metadata about the parameters and return type of a function using annotations.\n","\n","**Example**:\n","\n","```python\n","def greet(name: str) -> str:\n","    return f\"Hello, {name}!\"\n","```\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **9. Practical Scenarios for Functions**:\n","\n","- **Reusability**: Define functions once and use them throughout the code.\n","- **Modularity**: Break complex tasks into simpler, manageable pieces.\n","- **Debugging**: Isolate bugs easily by testing functions individually.\n","- **Enhancements**: Modify functions easily without affecting other parts of the code.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **Summary**:\n","\n","- **Functions** help you create organized, reusable, and modular code.\n","- **Lambda functions** provide a quick way to create small, one-time-use functions.\n","- **Scope** and **closures** ensure data is handled efficiently.\n","- **Recursion** and **higher-order functions** are powerful techniques for solving complex problems.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **Questions for Review**:\n","\n","1. What is the difference between parameters and arguments?\n","2. Explain how a lambda function differs from a regular function.\n","3. What are the purposes of `*args` and `**kwargs` in Python?\n","4.
