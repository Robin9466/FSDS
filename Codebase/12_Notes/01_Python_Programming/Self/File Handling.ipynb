What is File Handling?**\n","- File handling in Python is about **reading from** and **writing to files**.\n","- Python provides various functions and methods to interact with files stored on your system.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **2. Opening a File**\n","\n","- You use the **`open()`** function to open a file.\n","- Syntax:\n","  ```python\n","  file_object = open(filename, mode)\n","  ```\n","  \n","#### **File Modes**:\n","- **`'r'`**: Read mode (default).\n","- **`'w'`**: Write mode (overwrites existing file).\n","- **`'a'`**: Append mode (adds data to the end of the file).\n","- **`'r+'`**: Read and Write mode.\n","- **`'b'`**: Binary mode (used for non-text files like images, etc.).\n","\n","#### **Example**:\n","```python\n","file = open(\"example.txt\", 'r')\n","```\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **3. Closing a File**\n","\n","- Always **close the file** after performing operations to free up resources.\n","- Syntax:\n","  ```python\n","  file.close()\n","  ```\n","\n","#### **Example**:\n","```python\n","file = open(\"example.txt\", 'r')\n","# Operations here\n","file.close()\n","```\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **4. Reading from a File**\n","\n","- You can read the file contents using various methods.\n","  \n","#### **Methods to Read Files**:\n","1. **`read()`**: Reads the entire file.\n","   ```python\n","   content = file.read()\n","   ```\n","\n","2. **`readline()`**: Reads one line at a time.\n","   ```python\n","   line = file.readline()\n","   ```\n","\n","3. **`readlines()`**: Reads the entire file into a list of lines.\n","   ```python\n","   lines = file.readlines()\n","   ```\n","\n","#### **Example**:\n","```python\n","file = open(\"example.txt\", 'r')\n","content = file.read()  # Reads the entire content\n","print(content)\n","file.close()\n","```\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **5. Writing to a File**\n","\n","- You can write or append data to a file using `write()` or `writelines()`.\n","\n","#### **Writing with `write()`**:\n","- **`write()`** writes a string to the file.\n","  ```python\n","  file.write(\"Hello, World!\")\n","  ```\n","\n","#### **Writing with `writelines()`**:\n","- **`writelines()`** writes a list of strings to the file.\n","  ```python\n","  file.writelines([\"Hello\\n\", \"World!\\n\"])\n","  ```\n","\n","#### **Example**:\n","```python\n","file = open(\"example.txt\", 'w')\n","file.write(\"This is a new file.\")\n","file.close()\n","```\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **6. Appending to a File**\n","\n","- Use the **`'a'`** mode to append content at the end of an existing file.\n","\n","#### **Example**:\n","```python\n","file = open(\"example.txt\", 'a')\n","file.write(\"\\nAppending new content.\")\n","file.close()\n","```\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **7. Using `with` Statement (Context Manager)**\n","\n","- The **`with`** statement automatically handles closing the file after operations, even if exceptions occur.\n","  \n","#### **Syntax**:\n","```python\n","with open(filename, mode) as file:\n","    # Perform operations\n","```\n","\n","#### **Example**:\n","```python\n","with open(\"example.txt\", 'r') as file:\n","    content = file.read()\n","    print(content)  # File automatically closes after this block\n","```\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **8. File Pointer and `seek()`**\n","\n","- The **file pointer** determines the current position in the file.\n","- You can use the **`seek()`** method to move the pointer to a specific location.\n","\n","#### **Syntax**:\n","```python\n","file.seek(offset, whence)\n","```\n","\n","- **`offset`**: The position to move to.\n","- **`whence`**: Starting point (0 = beginning, 1 = current position, 2 = end).\n","\n","#### **Example**:\n","```python\n","file = open(\"example.txt\", 'r')\n","file.seek(0)  # Move to the beginning of the file\n","print(file.read())\n","file.close()\n","```\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **9. Handling Binary Files**\n","\n","- Binary files, such as images or videos, are handled in **binary mode** using the **`'b'`** flag.\n","\n","#### **Example**: Reading a binary file.\n","```python\n","with open(\"image.jpg\", 'rb') as binary_file:\n","    data = binary_file.read()\n","    print(data)  # Outputs the binary data\n","```\n","\n","#### **Example**: Writing to a binary file.\n","```python\n","with open(\"output.jpg\", 'wb') as binary_file:\n","    binary_file.write(data)\n","```\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **10. Checking if a File Exists**\n","\n","- Before opening a file, it's good practice to check if the file exists.\n","- Use **`os.path.exists()`** to check.\n","\n","#### **Example**:\n","```python\n","import os\n","\n","if os.path.exists(\"example.txt\"):\n","    with open(\"example.txt\", 'r') as file:\n","        print(file.read())\n","else:\n","    print(\"File does not exist.\")\n","```\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **11. Deleting a File**\n","\n","- To delete a file, use **`os.remove()`** from the `os` module.\n","\n","#### **Example**:\n","```python\n","import os\n","\n","if os.path.exists(\"example.txt\"):\n","    os.remove(\"example.txt\")\n","else:\n","    print(\"File not found.\")\n","```\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **12. Use Cases of File Handling**\n","\n","1. **Reading Logs**: Process log files for debugging.\n","2. **Storing Data**: Write data to a file for permanent storage.\n","3. **Config Files**: Read and write configuration settings.\n","4. **Large Data Processing**: Read and process data from large files in chunks.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **Key Points to Remember**\n","\n","1. Always **close files** after use (or use the `with` statement).\n","2. Use the appropriate file **mode** (`r`, `w`, `a`, `b`).\n","3. For binary files (like images), use **`'b'` mode**.\n","4. **Error handling** is important when working with files to prevent crashes if the file doesn't exist.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **Summary**:\n","\n","- **File handling** is crucial for reading and writing data to and from text and binary files.\n","- The `open()`, `read()`, `write()`, and `with` statements are essential to mastering file operations.\n","- Always close files after use or use the `with` statement for automatic file closure.\n","\n","---\n"],"metadata":{"id":"nCneIkzUq4jQ"}}]}
