These objects are instances of classes that encapsulate both data (attributes) and behavior (methods). OOP helps organize code in a way that makes it reusable, modular, and easier to maintain.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **Four Pillars of OOP**\n","1. **Encapsulation**\n","   - **Definition:** Encapsulation is the technique of bundling data and methods that manipulate the data within a single unit, typically a class. It also restricts access to certain components.\n","   - **Purpose:** It ensures data is hidden from outside interference and misuse.\n","   - **Analogy:** Imagine a remote control: you can only press buttons (methods) to interact with it, without seeing how it works internally (data).\n","   - **Example:**\n","     ```python\n","     class Car:\n","         def __init__(self, make, model):\n","             self.__make = make  # Private attribute\n","             self.__model = model\n","\n","         def get_car_info(self):\n","             return f\"{self.__make} - {self.__model}\"\n","     ```\n","\n","2. **Abstraction**\n","   - **Definition:** Abstraction hides complex implementation details and only exposes essential features.\n","   - **Purpose:** It reduces complexity and allows users to interact with a simplified interface.\n","   - **Analogy:** Think of driving a car: you don’t need to know how the engine works to drive it.\n","   - **Example:**\n","     ```python\n","     class CoffeeMachine:\n","         def make_coffee(self):\n","             self.__heat_water()\n","             self.__grind_beans()\n","             return \"Your coffee is ready!\"\n","     ```\n","\n","3. **Inheritance**\n","   - **Definition:** Inheritance allows one class (child class) to acquire properties and behaviors from another class (parent class).\n","   - **Purpose:** It promotes code reuse and creates a hierarchical relationship between classes.\n","   - **Analogy:** A child inheriting traits from their parents—like eye color or height—is similar to how a class inherits attributes from its parent.\n","   - **Example:**\n","     ```python\n","     class Animal:\n","         def speak(self):\n","             return \"Animal speaks\"\n","         \n","     class Dog(Animal):\n","         def speak(self):\n","             return \"Dog barks\"\n","     ```\n","\n","4. **Polymorphism**\n","   - **Definition:** Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to respond to the same method call in their own way.\n","   - **Purpose:** It provides flexibility in code by allowing different objects to use the same interface.\n","   - **Analogy:** Imagine the word \"play\": it could mean playing a video, playing a song, or playing a game depending on the context.\n","   - **Example:**\n","     ```python\n","     class Bird:\n","         def fly(self):\n","             return \"Flies in the sky\"\n","     \n","     class Penguin(Bird):\n","         def fly(self):\n","             return \"Can't fly but swims\"\n","     ```\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **Key Concepts in OOP**\n","\n","1. **Class and Object**\n","   - **Class:** A blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines attributes and methods.\n","   - **Object:** An instance of a class that contains actual values for the class’s attributes.\n","   - **Analogy:** A class is like a cookie cutter, and objects are the cookies made from it.\n","   - **Example:**\n","     ```python\n","     class Book:\n","         def __init__(self, title, author):\n","             self.title = title\n","             self.author = author\n","\n","     my_book = Book(\"1984\", \"George Orwell\")\n","     ```\n","\n","2. **Constructor**\n","   - **Definition:** A constructor is a special method in a class that is automatically invoked when an object is created, initializing the object’s attributes.\n","   - **Purpose:** It prepares the object for use by setting its initial state.\n","   - **Example:**\n","     ```python\n","     class Person:\n","         def __init__(self, name, age):\n","             self.name = name\n","             self.age = age\n","     ```\n","\n","3. **Method Overloading and Overriding**\n","   - **Overloading:** Allows multiple methods with the same name but different parameters.\n","   - **Overriding:** Allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation of a method already defined in its parent class.\n","   - **Example (Overriding):**\n","     ```python\n","     class Parent:\n","         def greet(self):\n","             return \"Hello from Parent\"\n","     \n","     class Child(Parent):\n","         def greet(self):\n","             return \"Hello from Child\"\n","     ```\n","\n","4. **Access Modifiers**\n","   - **Public:** Accessible from anywhere.\n","   - **Private:** Accessible only within the class.\n","   - **Protected:** Accessible within the class and its subclasses.\n","   - **Purpose:** Controls how much access other parts of the program have to the data and methods within a class.\n","   - **Example:**\n","     ```python\n","     class Employee:\n","         def __init__(self, name, salary):\n","             self.name = name  # Public attribute\n","             self.__salary = salary  # Private attribute\n","     ```\n","\n","5. **Static Methods**\n","   - **Definition:** Methods that belong to the class itself rather than any object instance.\n","   - **Purpose:** Used for functionality related to the class rather than any individual object.\n","   - **Example:**\n","     ```python\n","     class MathOperations:\n","         @staticmethod\n","         def add(a, b):\n","             return a + b\n","     ```\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **Questions to Reinforce Learning**\n","\n","1. What is the difference between encapsulation and abstraction?\n","2. How does inheritance enhance code reusability?\n","3. Why is polymorphism important for flexibility in OOP?\n","4. Can you give an example of method overriding in Python?\n","5. How do constructors help in object creation?\n","6. What is the purpose of access modifiers in a class?\n","7. When would you use static methods in Python?\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **Summary of Object-Oriented Programming**\n","\n","Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) structures programs around objects rather than functions or logic. Key principles include **Encapsulation**, which hides an object's data; **Abstraction**, which simplifies interactions by hiding complexity; **Inheritance**, which promotes reusability; and **Polymorphism**, which enhances flexibility by allowing objects to share behaviors. A **class** is a blueprint, while an **object** is an instance of that class. Concepts like **constructors** help initialize objects, **method overriding** allows customized behavior in subclasses, and **static methods** are class-level methods. Understanding OOP enables better code structure, maintainability, and scalability.\n","\n","---"],"metadata":{"id":"f-gFuXtShRqw"}}]}
