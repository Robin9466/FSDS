Data Cleaning\n","\n","**Definition**:  \n","Data cleaning is the process of detecting and correcting (or removing) inaccurate records from a dataset. It's crucial to ensure that your data is reliable and usable for analysis.\n","\n","**Key Concepts**:\n","- **Handling Missing Values**:\n","  - **Drop Missing Values**: Remove rows or columns with missing data.\n","  - **Fill Missing Values**: Use methods like forward-fill, backward-fill, or fill with a specific value (mean, median).\n","  \n","- **Removing Duplicates**:\n","  - Identifying and dropping duplicate records to maintain data integrity.\n","\n","- **Correcting Data Types**:\n","  - Ensure that each column has the correct data type (e.g., integers, floats, dates) for accurate analysis.\n","\n","- **Library**:\n","  - **Pandas**: Provides functions for data cleaning and preprocessing.\n","\n","- **Example Usage**:\n","Here's how to clean a DataFrame in Pandas:\n","\n","```python\n","import pandas as pd\n","\n","# Sample data with missing values and duplicates\n","data = {\n","    'Title': ['Video 1', 'Video 2', None, 'Video 2'],\n","    'URL': ['http://youtube.com/video1', 'http://youtube.com/video2', 'http://youtube.com/video3', 'http://youtube.com/video2']\n","}\n","\n","# Create a DataFrame\n","df = pd.DataFrame(data)\n","\n","# Drop duplicates\n","df.drop_duplicates(inplace=True)\n","\n","# Fill missing values\n","df['Title'].fillna('Unknown', inplace=True)\n","\n","# Display cleaned DataFrame\n","print(df)\n","```"],"metadata":{"id":"XAZrq2gAwBuM"}}]}
