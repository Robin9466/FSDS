Concurrency\n","\n","**Definition**:  \n","Concurrency refers to the ability to run multiple tasks simultaneously, allowing for more efficient data scraping, especially when dealing with a large volume of requests. In Python, this can be achieved using asynchronous programming or multithreading.\n","\n","**Key Concepts**:\n","- **Asynchronous Programming**:\n","  - Uses the `asyncio` library to run multiple tasks at the same time without blocking the main thread.\n","  - Ideal for I/O-bound operations, such as making network requests.\n","\n","- **Multithreading**:\n","  - Uses the `threading` library to create multiple threads that run concurrently.\n","  - Suitable for CPU-bound tasks but can also be used for I/O-bound tasks.\n","\n","- **Rate Limiting**:\n","  - Be cautious of making too many requests in a short period to avoid being rate-limited or blocked by the server.\n","\n","**Example Usage (Asynchronous)**:\n","Hereâ€™s an example using `asyncio` and `aiohttp` for making asynchronous requests:\n","\n","```python\n","import asyncio\n","import aiohttp\n","\n","API_KEY = 'YOUR_API_KEY'\n","VIDEO_IDS = ['dQw4w9WgXcQ', '3JZ_D3ELwOQ', 'ZbZSe6AiEP0']  # List of video IDs\n","\n","async def fetch_video_data(video_id):\n","    url = f'https://www.googleapis.com/youtube/v3/videos?id={video_id}&key={API_KEY}&part=snippet'\n","    async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:\n","        async with session.get(url) as response:\n","            data = await response.json()\n","            return data\n","\n","async def main():\n","    tasks = [fetch_video_data(video_id) for video_id in VIDEO_IDS]\n","    results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)\n","    \n","    for result in results:\n","        if 'items' in result and len(result['items']) > 0:\n","            video_title = result['items'][0]['snippet']['title']\n","            print(f'Title: {video_title}')\n","        else:\n","            print('Video not found.')\n","\n","# Run the main function\n","asyncio.run(main())\n","```"],"metadata":{"id":"6co06ff5yOQS"}}]}
