Web Scraping\n","\n","**Definition**:  \n","Web scraping is the process of automatically extracting information from web pages. For your YouTube project, you might want to scrape data from web pages that don’t have an API or to gather additional details not provided by the API.\n","\n","**Key Concepts**:\n","- **Libraries**:\n","  - **BeautifulSoup**: A Python library for parsing HTML and XML documents. It creates parse trees from page source codes, allowing for easy data extraction.\n","  - **Requests**: Used to send HTTP requests and get the web page content.\n","  \n","- **Understanding HTML Structure**:\n","  - Learn the basics of HTML to identify tags, classes, and IDs where data is stored.\n","  - Use browser developer tools (like Chrome DevTools) to inspect the elements of the web pages you want to scrape.\n","\n","- **Robots.txt**:\n","  - Before scraping a website, check its `robots.txt` file (e.g., `https://www.example.com/robots.txt`) to see if scraping is allowed and what sections of the site are off-limits.\n","\n","- **Rate Limiting**:\n","  - Respect the website's server by not sending too many requests in a short period. Use `time.sleep()` to add delays between requests.\n","\n","**Example Usage**:\n","Here’s an example of how to scrape video titles from a YouTube search result page:\n","\n","```python\n","import requests\n","from bs4 import BeautifulSoup\n","\n","SEARCH_QUERY = 'Python programming'\n","url = f'https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query={SEARCH_QUERY}'\n","\n","response = requests.get(url)\n","soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')\n","\n","# Find all video titles\n","titles = soup.find_all('h3', class_='title-and-badge style-scope ytd-video-renderer')\n","\n","for title in titles:\n","    print(title.get_text())\n","```"],"metadata":{"id":"DL8yfqwovgyk"}}]}
