Data Storage\n","\n","**Definition**:  \n","Data storage refers to how you save the data you collect from your YouTube scraping project. It’s important to choose a storage method that allows easy access and manipulation of the data later.\n","\n","**Key Concepts**:\n","- **File Formats**:\n","  - **CSV (Comma-Separated Values)**: A simple text format for storing tabular data. Great for small to medium datasets and can be easily read by Excel and other data manipulation tools.\n","  - **JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)**: A lightweight format for storing and exchanging data. Useful for hierarchical data and widely used in web applications.\n","  - **Databases**: For larger datasets or when you need complex queries, consider using databases like SQLite, MySQL, or PostgreSQL.\n","\n","- **Libraries**:\n","  - **Pandas**: Used for data manipulation and analysis. It can read and write data in various formats (CSV, Excel, JSON, SQL).\n","  - **SQLite3**: A lightweight database engine that comes with Python. Good for small to medium-sized applications.\n","\n","- **Example Usage**:\n","Here’s how to save scraped data to a CSV file using Pandas:\n","\n","```python\n","import pandas as pd\n","\n","# Sample data\n","data = {\n","    'Title': ['Video 1', 'Video 2', 'Video 3'],\n","    'URL': ['http://youtube.com/video1', 'http://youtube.com/video2', 'http://youtube.com/video3']\n","}\n","\n","# Create a DataFrame\n","df = pd.DataFrame(data)\n","\n","# Save to CSV\n","df.to_csv('youtube_videos.csv', index=False)\n","```"],"metadata":{"id":"uC__TqH6vuUK"}}]}
