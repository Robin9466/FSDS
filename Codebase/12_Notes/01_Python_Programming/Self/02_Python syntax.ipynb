Key points include:\n","\n","- **Variables and Data Types:** Python automatically assigns data types (`int`, `float`, `str`, etc.) based on the value you assign. Mutable types like `list` can change, while immutable types like `tuple` remain fixed.\n","  \n","- **Comments:** Essential for documentation and maintaining code clarity, using `#` for single-line comments and `\"\"\"` for multi-line ones.\n","\n","- **Control Structures:** Python provides decision-making (`if-else`) and looping (`for`, `while`) structures to control the flow of a program.\n","\n","- **Functions:** Defined using `def`, functions help organize code for reuse and modularization.\n","\n","- **Input and Output:** User input is taken via the `input()` function, and `print()` displays output on the console.\n","\n","- **Exceptions:** Python handles runtime errors using `try-except` blocks, with optional `finally` to run code regardless of the exception.\n","\n","- **OOP with Classes and Objects:** Python supports Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) using `class` and `self` keywords to define object properties and methods.\n","\n","- **Importing Modules:** Extend functionality by importing built-in or external libraries (`import module_name`) and use specific methods by importing functions (`from module_name import function_name`).\n","\n","- **List Comprehensions:** Offer a compact way to generate lists, simplifying loops and conditional list creation.\n","\n","- **File Handling:** Easily read from and write to files using context managers.\n","\n","- **Lambda Functions, Map, Filter, Reduce:** Provide functional programming capabilities for cleaner and more efficient code.\n","\n","- **Decorators:** Allow modification of function behavior in a clean and readable way.\n","\n","- **List Methods:** Provide built-in functions to manipulate lists conveniently.\n","\n","---"],"metadata":{"id":"CGaP6BIymPQg"}}]}
