Decorators provide a convenient way to modify or enhance functions or methods.\n","\n","#### 2. **Key Concepts**:\n","- **Higher-Order Functions**: Decorators are higher-order functions because they accept a function as an argument and return a new function.\n","- **Syntax**: Decorators are applied using the `@decorator_name` syntax just before the function definition.\n","\n","#### 3. **Basic Example**:\n","```python\n","def my_decorator(func):\n","    def wrapper():\n","        print(\"Something is happening before the function is called.\")\n","        func()\n","        print(\"Something is happening after the function is called.\")\n","    return wrapper\n","\n","@my_decorator\n","def say_hello():\n","    print(\"Hello!\")\n","\n","# Usage:\n","say_hello()\n","# Output:\n","# Something is happening before the function is called.\n","# Hello!\n","# Something is happening after the function is called.\n","```\n","\n","#### 4. **How It Works**:\n","- The `@my_decorator` syntax replaces the function `say_hello` with the result of `my_decorator(say_hello)`, which is the `wrapper` function.\n","- When `say_hello` is called, it executes the code in the `wrapper` function, which includes calls to the original `say_hello` function.\n","\n","#### 5. **Chaining Decorators**:\n","You can apply multiple decorators to a single function by stacking them.\n","\n","##### Example:\n","```python\n","def bold_decorator(func):\n","    def wrapper():\n","        return f\"<b>{func()}</b>\"\n","    return wrapper\n","\n","def italic_decorator(func):\n","    def wrapper():\n","        return f\"<i>{func()}</i>\"\n","    return wrapper\n","\n","@bold_decorator\n","@italic_decorator\n","def greet():\n","    return \"Hello, World!\"\n","\n","# Usage:\n","print(greet())  # Output: <b><i>Hello, World!</i></b>\n","```\n","\n","#### 6. **Common Use Cases**:\n","- **Logging**: Adding logging functionality to track when functions are called.\n","- **Authentication**: Checking user permissions before executing a function.\n","- **Caching**: Storing the results of expensive function calls for faster future access.\n","\n","#### 7. **Passing Arguments to Decorators**:\n","To create a decorator that accepts arguments, you can nest functions.\n","\n","##### Example:\n","```python\n","def repeat(num_times):\n","    def decorator_repeat(func):\n","        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):\n","            for _ in range(num_times):\n","                func(*args, **kwargs)\n","        return wrapper\n","    return decorator_repeat\n","\n","@repeat(num_times=3)\n","def greet(name):\n","    print(f\"Hello, {name}!\")\n","\n","# Usage:\n","greet(\"Alice\")\n","# Output:\n","# Hello, Alice!\n","# Hello, Alice!\n","# Hello, Alice!\n","```\n","\n","#### 8. **Built-in Decorators**:\n","- **@staticmethod**: Defines a method that does not access the instance or class.\n","- **@classmethod**: Defines a method that receives the class as the first argument instead of the instance.\n","- **@property**: Allows you to define getters and setters in a class.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **Questions**:\n","1. **What is the purpose of a decorator in Python?**\n","   - A decorator is used to extend the behavior of a function or method without modifying its code.\n","\n","2. **How do you pass arguments to a decorator?**\n","   - You can create a decorator that takes arguments by nesting functions: the outer function takes the arguments, and the inner function defines the actual decorator logic.\n","\n","---"],"metadata":{"id":"D0MPpRQxrgCa"}}]}
