**Modularity**: Code is divided into objects, making it easier to understand and manage.\n","  - **Reusability**: Classes can be reused in different programs.\n","  - **Extensibility**: Existing code can be extended with new features without changing much of the existing code.\n","  - **Maintainability**: Changes can be made easily without affecting the entire program.\n","\n","#### 2. **What is OOP?**\n","- **Definition**: OOP is a programming style that focuses on using objects and classes to create models based on the real world.\n","- **Key Concepts**:\n","  - **Classes**: Blueprints for creating objects.\n","  - **Objects**: Instances of classes with attributes and behaviors.\n","  - **Methods**: Functions defined inside a class that describe the behaviors of the object.\n","  \n","#### 3. **Class and Object**\n","- **Class**:\n","  - A template for creating objects.\n","  - Contains attributes (data) and methods (functions) that define the behavior of objects.\n","  - **Example**:\n","    ```python\n","    class Car:\n","        def __init__(self, brand, model):\n","            self.brand = brand\n","            self.model = model\n","\n","        def display(self):\n","            print(f\"Car: {self.brand} {self.model}\")\n","    ```\n","- **Object**:\n","  - An instance of a class with specific data.\n","  - Created using the class constructor.\n","  - **Example**:\n","    ```python\n","    my_car = Car(\"Toyota\", \"Camry\")\n","    my_car.display()  # Output: Car: Toyota Camry\n","    ```\n","\n","#### 4. **Constructor**\n","- **Definition**: A special method in a class that is called automatically when an object is created.\n","- **Purpose**: Initializes the object's attributes.\n","- **Why Use a Constructor?**:\n","  - To set initial values for object properties.\n","  - To ensure that objects are created with valid data.\n","- **Syntax**:\n","  ```python\n","  def __init__(self, parameters):\n","      # Initialize object attributes\n","  ```\n","- **Example**:\n","  ```python\n","  class Person:\n","      def __init__(self, name, age):\n","          self.name = name\n","          self.age = age\n","\n","      def display(self):\n","          print(f\"Name: {self.name}, Age: {self.age}\")\n","\n","  person1 = Person(\"Alice\", 30)\n","  person1.display()  # Output: Name: Alice, Age: 30\n","  ```\n","\n","#### 5. **Role of the Constructor**\n","- **Initialization**: Sets the initial state of the object.\n","- **Data Validation**: Ensures that the object is created with valid data.\n","- **Encapsulation**: Hides the internal representation of the object.\n","\n","#### 6. **Types of Constructors**\n","- **Default Constructor**:\n","  - Takes no parameters.\n","  - Initializes default values.\n","  - **Example**:\n","    ```python\n","    class Sample:\n","        def __init__(self):\n","            self.value = 0\n","\n","    obj = Sample()\n","    print(obj.value)  # Output: 0\n","    ```\n","- **Parameterized Constructor**:\n","  - Takes parameters to initialize specific values.\n","  - **Example**:\n","    ```python\n","    class Sample:\n","        def __init__(self, value):\n","            self.value = value\n","\n","    obj = Sample(10)\n","    print(obj.value)  # Output: 10\n","    ```\n","\n","#### 7. **What is `self` in Constructor?**\n","- **`self`**: Refers to the current instance of the class.\n","- Used to access variables and methods within the class.\n","- **Example**:\n","  ```python\n","  class Sample:\n","      def __init__(self, value):\n","          self.value = value  # `self.value` refers to the object's attribute\n","\n","      def show(self):\n","          print(self.value)\n","\n","  obj = Sample(10)\n","  obj.show()  # Output: 10\n","  ```\n","\n","#### 8. **Object Creation Process**\n","- When an object is created, the following steps occur:\n","  1. **Memory Allocation**: Memory is allocated for the object.\n","  2. **Constructor Call**: The constructor is called to initialize the object.\n","  3. **Attribute Initialization**: The attributes are initialized with values.\n","  4. **Object is Ready**: The object is ready for use with initialized data.\n","\n","### Principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)\n","\n","#### 1. **Encapsulation**\n","**Definition**: Encapsulation is about keeping the internal state and behavior of an object hidden from the outside world. It provides a way to bundle data and methods that operate on that data into a single unit (class) and restricts access to some of the object’s components.\n","\n","**Purpose**:\n","- **Data Protection**: Protects the internal data from outside interference and misuse.\n","- **Control**: Allows you to control how the data is accessed and modified.\n","- **Simplification**: Simplifies the use of objects by hiding the complex internal details.\n","\n","**Analogy**: Think of a vending machine. You just press buttons to get your snack or drink, but you don’t need to know how the machine sorts the money and releases the item. The machine’s complex mechanism is hidden from you, providing only the necessary interface.\n","\n","**Example**:\n","```python\n","class BankAccount:\n","    \"\"\"\n","    A class to represent a bank account with basic deposit, withdraw, and balance check features.\n","    \"\"\"\n","\n","    def __init__(self, initial_balance):\n","        \"\"\"\n","        Constructor to initialize the account with an initial balance.\n","        :param initial_balance: The starting balance of the account.\n","        \"\"\"\n","        # Private attribute, can't be accessed directly from outside\n","        self.__balance = initial_balance\n","\n","    def deposit(self, amount):\n","        \"\"\"\n","        Add money to the account.\n","        :param amount: The amount to be deposited.\n","        \"\"\"\n","        if amount > 0:\n","            self.__balance += amount\n","\n","    def withdraw(self, amount):\n","        \"\"\"\n","        Remove money from the account if sufficient funds are available.\n","        :param amount: The amount to be withdrawn.\n","        :return: The withdrawn amount or a message indicating insufficient funds.\n","        \"\"\"\n","        if 0 < amount <= self.__balance:\n","            self.__balance -= amount\n","            return amount\n","        else:\n","            return \"Insufficient funds\"\n","\n","    def get_balance(self):\n","        \"\"\"\n","        Get the current balance of the account.\n","        :return: The current balance.\n","        \"\"\"\n","        return self.__balance\n","\n","# Creating a BankAccount object with an initial balance of 1000\n","account = BankAccount(1000)\n","account.deposit(500)  # Deposits 500 into the account\n","print(account.get_balance())  # Output: 1500\n","account.withdraw(200)  # Withdraws 200 from the account\n","print(account.get_balance())  # Output: 1300\n","\n","# Trying to access private attribute directly (This will cause an error)\n","# print(account.__balance)  # Uncommenting this line will raise an AttributeError\n","```\n","**Explanation**:\n","- `__balance` is a private attribute, and it's protected from direct access outside the class.\n","- The methods `deposit()`, `withdraw()`, and `get_balance()` control how the `__balance` attribute is modified or accessed.\n","\n","#### 2. **Abstraction**\n","**Definition**: Abstraction involves hiding complex details and showing only the essential features of an object. It allows you to focus on what an object does rather than how it does it.\n","\n","**Purpose**:\n","- **Reduce Complexity**: Simplifies the user’s interaction by hiding unnecessary details.\n","- **Ease of Use**: Provides a simple interface for the user.\n","\n","**Analogy**: A TV remote control. You only need to know how to press the buttons to control the TV. You don’t need to understand the electronics inside the remote or TV.\n","\n","**Example**:\n","```python\n","from abc import ABC, abstractmethod\n","\n","class Shape(ABC):\n","    \"\"\"\n","    An abstract base class for different shapes.\n","    \"\"\"\n","\n","    @abstractmethod\n","    def area(self):\n","        \"\"\"\n","        Abstract method to calculate the area of the shape.\n","        \"\"\"\n","        pass\n","\n","    @abstractmethod\n","    def perimeter(self):\n","        \"\"\"\n","        Abstract method to calculate the perimeter of the shape.\n","        \"\"\"\n","        pass\n","\n","class Rectangle(Shape):\n","    \"\"\"\n","    A class to represent a rectangle.\n","    \"\"\"\n","\n","    def __init__(self, width, height):\n","        \"\"\"\n","        Constructor to initialize width and height of the rectangle.\n","        :param width: The width of the rectangle.\n","        :param height: The height of the rectangle.\n","        \"\"\"\n","        self.width = width\n","        self.height = height\n","\n","    def area(self):\n","        \"\"\"\n","        Calculate the area of the rectangle.\n","        :return: The area of the rectangle.\n","        \"\"\"\n","        return self.width * self.height\n","\n","    def perimeter(self):\n","        \"\"\"\n","        Calculate the perimeter of the rectangle.\n","        :return: The perimeter of the rectangle.\n","        \"\"\"\n","        return 2 * (self.width + self.height)\n","\n","class Circle(Shape):\n","    \"\"\"\n","    A class to represent a circle.\n","    \"\"\"\n","\n","    def __init__(self, radius):\n","        \"\"\"\n","        Constructor to initialize the radius of the circle.\n","        :param radius: The radius of the circle.\n","        \"\"\"\n","        self.radius = radius\n","\n","    def area(self):\n","        \"\"\"\n","        Calculate the area of the circle.\n","        :return: The area of the circle.\n","        \"\"\"\n","        return 3.14 * self.radius ** 2\n","\n","    def perimeter(self):\n","        \"\"\"\n","        Calculate the perimeter of the circle.\n","        :return: The perimeter of the circle.\n","        \"\"\"\n","        return 2 * 3.14 * self.radius\n","\n","# Creating objects for Rectangle and Circle\n","rectangle = Rectangle(5, 10)\n","circle = Circle(7)\n","\n","print(\"Rectangle Area:\", rectangle.area())  # Output: Rectangle Area: 50\n","print(\"Rectangle Perimeter:\", rectangle.perimeter())  # Output: Rectangle Perimeter: 30\n","print(\"Circle Area:\", circle.area())  # Output: Circle Area: 153.86\n","print(\"Circle Perimeter:\", circle.perimeter())  # Output: 43.96\n","```\n","**Explanation**:\n","- The `Shape` class is an abstract class and serves as a blueprint for other shapes.\n","- `Rectangle` and `Circle` are concrete classes that implement the methods defined in `Shape`.\n","- Users interact with the simple methods `area()` and `perimeter()` without needing to know the complex formulas inside them.\n","\n","#### 3. **Inheritance**\n","**Definition**: Inheritance allows a class (child) to inherit properties and behaviors (methods) from another class (parent). This allows you to reuse existing code and create a hierarchy of classes.\n","\n","**Purpose**:\n","- **Code Reusability**: Avoids duplicating code by reusing existing code from the parent class.\n","- **Hierarchy**: Creates a relationship between classes, allowing for the creation of complex structures.\n","\n","**Analogy**: Think of a child inheriting features like eye color and hair type from their parents. Similarly, a class inherits attributes and methods from its parent class.\n","\n","**Example**:\n","```python\n","class Animal:\n","    \"\"\"\n","    A parent class to represent general animals.\n","    \"\"\"\n","\n","    def __init__(self, name):\n","        \"\"\"\n","        Constructor to initialize the name of the animal.\n","        :param name: The name of the animal.\n","        \"\"\"\n","        self.name = name\n","\n","    def sound(self):\n","        \"\"\"\n","        General sound of an animal.\n","        :return: A generic sound.\n","        \"\"\"\n","        return \"Some generic sound\"\n","\n","class Dog(Animal):\n","    \"\"\"\n","    A child class inheriting from Animal, representing a dog.\n","    \"\"\"\n","\n","    def sound(self):\n","        \"\"\"\n","        Specific sound of a dog.\n","        :return: The sound of a dog.\n","        \"\"\"\n","        return \"Bark\"\n","\n","class Cat(Animal):\n","    \"\"\"\n","    A child class inheriting from Animal, representing a cat.\n","    \"\"\"\n","\n","    def sound(self):\n","        \"\"\"\n","        Specific sound of a cat.\n","        :return: The sound of a cat.\n","        \"\"\"\n","        return \"Meow\"\n","\n","# Creating objects of Dog and Cat\n","dog = Dog(\"Buddy\")\n","cat = Cat(\"Kitty\")\n","\n","print(f\"{dog.name} says {dog.sound()}\")  # Output: Buddy says Bark\n","print(f\"{cat.name} says {cat.sound()}\")  # Output: Kitty says Meow\n","```\n","**Explanation**:\n","- `Animal` is the parent class with a general method `sound()`.\n","- `Dog` and `Cat` classes inherit from `Animal` and override the `sound()` method with specific implementations.\n","- The child classes inherit the `name` attribute from the parent class.\n","\n","#### 4. **Polymorphism**\n","**Definition**: Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It means the same function can be used for different types of objects, providing flexibility and reusability.\n","\n","**Purpose**:\n","- **Flexibility**: Allows the same interface to be used for different underlying forms (data types).\n","- **Simplification**: Simplifies the code by using a single interface for multiple objects.\n","\n","**Analogy**: Imagine a single remote control that can operate your TV, air conditioner, and sound system. The remote sends different signals based on the device it controls, but the user interface remains the same.\n","\n","**Example**:\n","```python\n","class Bird:\n","    \"\"\"\n","    A class to represent a bird.\n","    \"\"\"\n","\n","    def fly(self):\n","        \"\"\"\n","        Specific flying behavior of a bird.\n","        \"\"\"\n","        print(\"Bird is flying\")\n","\n","class Airplane:\n","    \"\"\"\n","    A class to represent an airplane.\n","    \"\"\"\n","\n","    def fly(self):\n","        \"\"\"\n","        Specific flying behavior of an airplane.\n","        \"\"\"\n","        print(\"Airplane is flying\")\n","\n","class Fish:\n","    \"\"\"\n","    A class to represent a fish.\n","    \"\"\"\n","\n","    def swim(self):\n","        \"\"\"\n","        Specific swimming behavior of a fish.\n","        \"\"\"\n","        print(\"Fish is swimming\")\n","\n","def make_it_fly(entity):\n","    \"\"\"\n","    A function that makes an entity fly if it has a fly() method.\n","    :param entity: The entity that should fly.\n","    \"\"\"\n","    entity.fly()\n","\n","# Creating objects for Bird and Airplane\n","bird = Bird()\n","airplane =\n","\n"," Airplane()\n","\n","make_it_fly(bird)      # Output: Bird is flying\n","make_it_fly(airplane)  # Output: Airplane is flying\n","\n","# make_it_fly(Fish())  # Uncommenting this line will cause an AttributeError as Fish has no fly() method.\n","```\n","**Explanation**:\n","- Both `Bird` and `Airplane` classes have a `fly()` method, although they are unrelated classes.\n","- The `make_it_fly()` function can take any object that has a `fly()` method, demonstrating polymorphism.\n","\n","### Summary\n","These four OOP principles—encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism—help in creating well-structured, modular, and reusable code. They form the foundation for many modern software development practices and enable efficient and effective programming.\n","\n","In Python, the concepts of public, protected, and private attributes and methods define the visibility and accessibility of class members. Here’s a breakdown of each:\n","\n","### 1. Public\n","- **Definition**: Public members (attributes and methods) can be accessed from anywhere—both inside and outside the class.\n","- **Syntax**: No leading underscores.\n","- **Example**:\n","    ```python\n","    class Example:\n","        def __init__(self):\n","            self.public_var = \"I'm public\"\n","\n","    obj = Example()\n","    print(obj.public_var)  # Accessible\n","    ```\n","\n","### 2. Protected\n","- **Definition**: Protected members are intended to be accessed only within the class and its subclasses. They can be accessed outside the class, but it’s discouraged.\n","- **Syntax**: A single leading underscore (`_`).\n","- **Example**:\n","    ```python\n","    class Example:\n","        def __init__(self):\n","            self._protected_var = \"I'm protected\"\n","\n","    class SubExample(Example):\n","        def display(self):\n","            print(self._protected_var)  # Accessible in subclass\n","\n","    obj = SubExample()\n","    obj.display()  # Accessible\n","    print(obj._protected_var)  # Accessible, but discouraged\n","    ```\n","\n","### 3. Private\n","- **Definition**: Private members are intended to be accessed only within the class itself. They cannot be accessed directly from outside the class.\n","- **Syntax**: A double leading underscore (`__`).\n","- **Example**:\n","    ```python\n","    class Example:\n","        def __init__(self):\n","            self.__private_var = \"I'm private\"\n","\n","        def get_private_var(self):\n","            return self.__private_var  # Accessible within the class\n","\n","    obj = Example()\n","    print(obj.get_private_var())  # Accessible via a public method\n","    # print(obj.__private_var)  # Raises AttributeError\n","    ```\n","\n","### Summary Table\n","\n","| Access Level | Syntax               | Accessibility                                    |\n","|--------------|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------|\n","| Public       | No underscores        | Accessible anywhere                              |\n","| Protected    | Single underscore (`_`) | Accessible within class and subclasses (discouraged outside) |\n","| Private      | Double underscore (`__`) | Accessible only within the class                |\n","\n","### Key Takeaways\n","- **Public**: Open to all; use for general attributes/methods.\n","- **Protected**: Intended for internal use; avoid direct access from outside the class.\n","- **Private**: Strictly internal; cannot be accessed directly from outside the class, promoting encapsulation.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"f-gFuXtShRqw"}}]}
