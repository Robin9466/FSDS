The `except` block lets you handle the error.\n","\n","##### Example:\n","```python\n","try:\n","    x = 1 / 0  # This will raise a ZeroDivisionError\n","except ZeroDivisionError:\n","    print(\"You can't divide by zero!\")\n","```\n","\n","#### 4. **Multiple Exceptions**:\n","You can handle multiple exceptions using multiple `except` blocks.\n","\n","##### Example:\n","```python\n","try:\n","    x = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\n","    result = 10 / x\n","except ZeroDivisionError:\n","    print(\"You can't divide by zero!\")\n","except ValueError:\n","    print(\"Invalid input! Please enter a number.\")\n","```\n","\n","#### 5. **Generic Exception Handling**:\n","You can catch all exceptions using a generic `except` statement, but itâ€™s better to specify the exception types when possible.\n","\n","##### Example:\n","```python\n","try:\n","    # Some code that might raise an exception\n","    pass\n","except Exception as e:\n","    print(f\"An error occurred: {e}\")\n","```\n","\n","#### 6. **Using `finally`**:\n","The `finally` block executes after the `try` and `except` blocks, regardless of whether an exception was raised. It's typically used for cleanup actions.\n","\n","##### Example:\n","```python\n","try:\n","    file = open(\"example.txt\", \"r\")\n","except FileNotFoundError:\n","    print(\"File not found!\")\n","finally:\n","    print(\"This will always execute.\")\n","```\n","\n","#### 7. **Using `else`**:\n","The `else` block can be used after `except`. It executes if the `try` block does not raise an exception.\n","\n","##### Example:\n","```python\n","try:\n","    result = 10 / 2\n","except ZeroDivisionError:\n","    print(\"You can't divide by zero!\")\n","else:\n","    print(f\"The result is {result}.\")\n","```\n","\n","#### 8. **Raising Exceptions**:\n","You can raise exceptions manually using the `raise` keyword. This is useful for creating custom error messages.\n","\n","##### Example:\n","```python\n","def check_age(age):\n","    if age < 0:\n","        raise ValueError(\"Age cannot be negative.\")\n","\n","try:\n","    check_age(-5)\n","except ValueError as e:\n","    print(e)  # Output: Age cannot be negative.\n","```\n","\n","#### 9. **Custom Exceptions**:\n","You can create custom exception classes by inheriting from the built-in `Exception` class.\n","\n","##### Example:\n","```python\n","class MyCustomError(Exception):\n","    pass\n","\n","try:\n","    raise MyCustomError(\"This is a custom error.\")\n","except MyCustomError as e:\n","    print(e)  # Output: This is a custom error.\n","```\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **Questions**:\n","1. **What is the purpose of the `finally` block in error handling?**\n","   - The `finally` block is used to execute code regardless of whether an exception occurred, typically for cleanup operations.\n","\n","2. **How can you create a custom exception in Python?**\n","   - You can create a custom exception by defining a new class that inherits from the built-in `Exception` class.\n","\n","---"],"metadata":{"id":"GxYHBPg2tWD1"}}]}
