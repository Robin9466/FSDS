What is Logging?**\n","Logging is a method to record messages that describe the flow and state of a program, helping track what the program is doing and making it easier to identify issues.\n","\n","### **2. Why Use Logging?**\n","- **Debugging:** Helps in understanding what went wrong in your code.\n","- **Monitoring:** Keeps track of what your code is doing in production.\n","- **Auditing:** Records important events, like user actions.\n","\n","### **3. Basic Logging in Python**\n","Python has a built-in module called `logging`. Hereâ€™s a simple example:\n","\n","```python\n","import logging\n","\n","# Set up basic configuration for logging\n","logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)\n","\n","# Log some messages\n","logging.debug(\"This is a debug message\")    # Detailed information, typically for diagnosing problems\n","logging.info(\"This is an info message\")     # Confirmation that things are working as expected\n","logging.warning(\"This is a warning message\") # An indication that something unexpected happened\n","logging.error(\"This is an error message\")   # A more serious problem, the program may not be able to continue\n","logging.critical(\"This is a critical message\") # A very serious problem, the program itself may be unable to continue\n","```\n","\n","**Output:**  \n","```\n","INFO:root:This is an info message\n","WARNING:root:This is a warning message\n","ERROR:root:This is an error message\n","CRITICAL:root:This is a critical message\n","```\n","> Note: `logging.debug` won't show up because the default level is `INFO`.\n","\n","### **4. Log Levels Explained:**\n","- **DEBUG:** Detailed information, useful during development.\n","- **INFO:** General information about program execution.\n","- **WARNING:** An indication of something that might be a problem.\n","- **ERROR:** A problem that caused a function or part of the code to fail.\n","- **CRITICAL:** A serious error indicating the program may not be able to continue.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## **Debugging in Python**\n","\n","### **1. What is Debugging?**\n","Debugging is the process of finding and fixing errors or bugs in your code.\n","\n","### **2. Common Debugging Techniques:**\n","- **Print Statements:** Adding `print()` to see what your code is doing.\n","- **Using a Debugger:** Tools like `pdb` (Python Debugger) to pause and inspect the code step-by-step.\n","- **Exception Handling:** Using `try` and `except` blocks to catch and handle errors gracefully.\n","\n","### **3. Basic Debugging with `pdb`:**\n","```python\n","import pdb\n","\n","def add(a, b):\n","    pdb.set_trace()  # This will pause the code here\n","    return a + b\n","\n","result = add(3, 5)\n","print(result)\n","```\n","> When you run this, the program will pause at `pdb.set_trace()`, allowing you to inspect variables and step through the code.\n","\n","### **4. Common Debugging Commands:**\n","- **`n` (next):** Execute the next line of code.\n","- **`s` (step):** Step into a function call.\n","- **`c` (continue):** Continue execution until the next breakpoint.\n","- **`q` (quit):** Quit the debugger.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## **Advanced Logging in Python**\n","\n","### **1. Log Formatting:**\n","You can customize the format of your log messages to include more context, like the time, module name, and line number.\n","\n","```python\n","import logging\n","\n","logging.basicConfig(\n","    level=logging.DEBUG,\n","    format='%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s'\n",")\n","\n","logging.debug(\"This is a debug message\")\n","```\n","\n","**Output:**\n","```\n","2024-09-19 12:34:56,789 - root - DEBUG - This is a debug message\n","```\n","**Explanation:**\n","- `%(asctime)s`: Timestamp of the log entry.\n","- `%(name)s`: Name of the logger.\n","- `%(levelname)s`: Log level (e.g., DEBUG, INFO).\n","- `%(message)s`: The log message.\n","\n","### **2. Creating and Using Loggers:**\n","Instead of using the root logger, you can create separate loggers for different modules or components of your application.\n","\n","```python\n","import logging\n","\n","# Create a custom logger\n","logger = logging.getLogger('my_logger')\n","\n","# Set the log level\n","logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)\n","\n","# Create handlers\n","console_handler = logging.StreamHandler()\n","file_handler = logging.FileHandler('app.log')\n","\n","# Create formatters and add them to handlers\n","formatter = logging.Formatter('%(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')\n","console_handler.setFormatter(formatter)\n","file_handler.setFormatter(formatter)\n","\n","# Add handlers to the logger\n","logger.addHandler(console_handler)\n","logger.addHandler(file_handler)\n","\n","# Log messages\n","logger.info(\"This will appear on console and in the file\")\n","logger.debug(\"This is a debug message\")\n","```\n","\n","### **3. Rotating Log Files:**\n","Use `RotatingFileHandler` to manage log file sizes automatically.\n","\n","```python\n","from logging.handlers import RotatingFileHandler\n","\n","# Create a handler that rotates log files when they reach 1MB, keeping 3 backups\n","handler = RotatingFileHandler('app.log', maxBytes=1_000_000, backupCount=3)\n","logger.addHandler(handler)\n","```\n","- **maxBytes:** Maximum file size before rotating.\n","- **backupCount:** Number of old log files to keep.\n","\n","### **4. Logging Exceptions:**\n","You can log exceptions along with the stack trace.\n","\n","```python\n","try:\n","    1 / 0\n","except ZeroDivisionError:\n","    logger.exception(\"An error occurred\")\n","```\n","\n","**Output:**\n","```\n","my_logger - ERROR - An error occurred\n","Traceback (most recent call last):\n","  File \"<stdin>\", line 2, in <module>\n","ZeroDivisionError: division by zero\n","```\n","\n","---\n","\n","## **Advanced Debugging in Python**\n","\n","### **1. Using Breakpoints in IDEs:**\n","Modern IDEs like PyCharm, VS Code, or Jupyter notebooks have integrated debugging tools. You can set breakpoints by clicking on the line number, allowing you to pause and inspect variables.\n","\n","### **2. Conditional Breakpoints:**\n","Breakpoints that trigger only when a specific condition is met.\n","\n","```python\n","import pdb\n","\n","def check_number(n):\n","    if n > 5:\n","        pdb.set_trace()  # Only pause if condition is met\n","    print(f\"Number: {n}\")\n","\n","check_number(10)\n","```\n","**Explanation:**  \n","The debugger will pause only if `n > 5`.\n","\n","### **3. Debugging Using `pdb` Commands:**\n","- **`l` (list):** Show the source code around the current line.\n","- **`p variable_name`:** Print the value of a variable.\n","- **`! command`:** Execute a Python command in the current context.\n","\n","### **4. Debugging with `ipdb`:**\n","`ipdb` is an enhanced version of `pdb` with better user experience and features like syntax highlighting.\n","\n","```bash\n","pip install ipdb\n","```\n","Then, use it similarly to `pdb`:\n","\n","```python\n","import ipdb\n","ipdb.set_trace()\n","```\n","\n","---\n","\n","## **Summary of Logging and Debugging in Python**\n","\n","### **Logging**\n","1. **Definition**: A method to record messages that reflect the program's flow and state.\n","2. **Purpose**:\n","   - **Debugging**: Identifying issues in code.\n","   - **Monitoring**: Tracking program behavior in production.\n","   - **Auditing**: Recording significant events.\n","3. **Basic Usage**:\n","   - Use the `logging` module.\n","   - Example:\n","     ```python\n","     import logging\n","     logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)\n","     logging.info(\"This is an info message\")\n","     ```\n","4. **Log Levels**:\n","   - **DEBUG**: Detailed info for development.\n","   - **INFO**: General execution information.\n","   - **WARNING**: Possible issues.\n","   - **ERROR**: Code failures.\n","   - **CRITICAL**: Serious errors that may halt the program.\n","\n","### **Debugging**\n","1. **Definition**: The process of finding and fixing bugs in code.\n","2. **Common Techniques**:\n","   - **Print Statements**: Use `print()` to inspect code behavior.\n","   - **Debugger**: Tools like `pdb` to pause and inspect code.\n","   - **Exception Handling**: Use `try` and `except` to manage errors.\n","3. **Using `pdb`**:\n","   - Example:\n","     ```python\n","     import pdb\n","     def add(a, b):\n","         pdb.set_trace()\n","         return a + b\n","     ```\n","4. **Common Debugging Commands**:\n","   - **`n`**: Next line.\n","   - **`s`**: Step into function.\n","   - **`c`**: Continue execution.\n","   - **`q`**: Quit debugger.\n","\n","### **Advanced Logging**\n","1. **Log Formatting**: Customize log messages (timestamp, logger name, etc.).\n","   - Example:\n","     ```python\n","     logging.basicConfig(format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')\n","     ```\n","2. **Creating Loggers**: Use custom loggers for better organization.\n","   - Example:\n","     ```python\n","     logger = logging.getLogger('my_logger')\n","     ```\n","3. **Rotating Log Files**: Manage log sizes with `RotatingFileHandler`.\n","4. **Logging Exceptions**\n","\n",": Log errors with traceback for easier debugging.\n","\n","### **Advanced Debugging**\n","1. **Using IDEs**: Leverage built-in tools for setting breakpoints.\n","2. **Conditional Breakpoints**: Set breakpoints that trigger under specific conditions.\n","3. **Using `ipdb`**: Enhanced debugging experience.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## **Questions**\n","1.
