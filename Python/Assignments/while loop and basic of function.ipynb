Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation.[32]\n","\n","Python is dynamically-typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly procedural), object-oriented and functional programming. It is often described as a \"batteries included\" language due to its comprehensive standard library.[33][34]\n","\n","Guido van Rossum began working on Python in the late 1980s as a successor to the ABC programming language and first released it in 1991 as Python 0.9.0.[35] Python 2.0 was released in 2000 and introduced new features such as list comprehensions, cycle-detecting garbage collection, reference counting, and Unicode support. Python 3.0, released in 2008, was a major revision that is not completely backward-compatible with earlier versions. Python 2 was discontinued with version 2.7.18 in 2020.[36]\n","\n","Python consistently ranks as one of the most popular programming languagesc\"\"\"\n","\n","\n","q5 : Try to generate all the even number between 1- 1000\n","\n","q6 : Define a function for all the above problem statememnt  .\n","\n","q7 : write a code to get a time of your system\n","\n","q8 : Write a code to fetch date form your system\n","\n","q9 : Write a code to send a mail to your friend\n","\n","q10 : write a code to trigger alarm for you at scheduled time\n","\n","q11 : write a code to check ip address of your system\n","\n","q12 : Write a code to check a perticular installation in your system\n","\n","q13 : Write a code to convert any text in to voice\n","\n","q14 : you have to write a fun which will take string and return a len of\n","it without using a inbuilt fun len\n","\n","q15 :write a fun which will be able to print an index of all premitive element which you will pass\n","\n","q16 : Write a fun which will take input as a dict and give me out as a list of all the values\n","even in case of 2 level nesting it should work .\n","\n","q17 : write a function whihc will take multiple list as a input and give me concatnation of all the element as\n","and output\n","\n","q18 : Write a function which will whould return list of all the file name from a directory .\n","\n","q19 : write a function whihc will be able to read a image file and show it to you .\n","\n","q20 : write a function by which you will be able to append two PDF files .\n","\n","q21 : write a function which can help you to filter only word file from a directory .\n","\n","q22 : write a function which can read video file and play for you .\n","\n","q23 : write a function which will be able to shutdonw your system .\n","\n","q24 : Write a function which will whould return list of all the file name from a directory .\n","\n","q25 : write a function whihc will be able to access your mail .\n"]}]}
