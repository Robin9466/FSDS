Examples include lists, tuples, strings, and dictionaries. You can iterate over an iterable using a `for` loop.\n","  \n","- **Iterator**: An object that implements the iterator protocol, consisting of the `__iter__()` and `__next__()` methods. It allows you to traverse through all the elements of an iterable.\n","\n","#### 2. **Key Concepts**:\n","- **Iterator Protocol**:\n","  - The `__iter__()` method returns the iterator object itself.\n","  - The `__next__()` method returns the next value from the iterable. If there are no more items to return, it raises the `StopIteration` exception.\n","\n","- **Lazy Evaluation**: Iterators compute values on-the-fly, which can save memory when working with large datasets.\n","\n","#### 3. **Basic Example**:\n","```python\n","# Creating an iterator from a list\n","my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n","my_iterator = iter(my_list)\n","\n","print(next(my_iterator))  # Output: 1\n","print(next(my_iterator))  # Output: 2\n","print(next(my_iterator))  # Output: 3\n","# next(my_iterator)  # Raises StopIteration\n","```\n","\n","#### 4. **How It Works**:\n","- When you call `iter()` on an iterable, it returns an iterator.\n","- You can retrieve elements one at a time using the `next()` function until the iterator is exhausted, which raises `StopIteration`.\n","\n","#### 5. **Creating Custom Iterators**:\n","You can create your own iterator by defining a class that implements the iterator protocol.\n","\n","##### Example:\n","```python\n","class Countdown:\n","    def __init__(self, start):\n","        self.current = start\n","    \n","    def __iter__(self):\n","        return self\n","    \n","    def __next__(self):\n","        if self.current <= 0:\n","            raise StopIteration\n","        else:\n","            self.current -= 1\n","            return self.current + 1\n","\n","# Usage:\n","for number in Countdown(5):\n","    print(number)  # Output: 5, 4, 3, 2, 1\n","```\n","\n","#### 6. **Advantages**:\n","- **Memory Efficient**: Iterators provide a way to iterate through large datasets without loading everything into memory at once.\n","- **Chained Iteration**: You can create complex iterators by chaining them together (e.g., combining multiple iterators).\n","- **Flexible and Lazy**: Only compute values when requested, allowing for more efficient data processing.\n","\n","#### 7. **Use Cases**:\n","- **Data Streams**: Processing large files or streams of data without loading them entirely into memory.\n","- **Custom Data Structures**: Implementing custom data structures that require specific iteration behavior.\n","- **Generators**: Using generator functions (with the `yield` keyword) that provide a convenient way to create iterators.\n","\n","#### 8. **Common Built-in Iterables**:\n","- **Lists**: All lists are iterable.\n","- **Tuples**: Tuples can be iterated.\n","- **Sets**: Sets are iterable collections of unique elements.\n","- **Dictionaries**: Dictionaries can be iterated over keys, values, or items.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **Questions**:\n","1. **What is the difference between an iterable and an iterator?**\n","   - An iterable is an object that can be looped over (e.g., list, tuple), while an iterator is an object that implements the iterator protocol, allowing iteration through its elements one at a time.\n","\n","2. **How do you create a custom iterator?**\n","   - You create a custom iterator by defining a class with `__iter__()` and `__next__()` methods that manage the iteration process.\n","\n","---"],"metadata":{"id":"JWo8onSNq4VG"}}]}
