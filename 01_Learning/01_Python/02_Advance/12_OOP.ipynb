These objects are instances of classes that encapsulate both data (attributes) and behavior (methods). OOP helps organize code in a way that makes it reusable, modular, and easier to maintain.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **Four Pillars of OOP**\n","1. **Encapsulation**\n","   - **Definition:** Encapsulation is the technique of bundling data and methods that manipulate the data within a single unit, typically a class. It also restricts access to certain components.\n","   - **Purpose:** It ensures data is hidden from outside interference and misuse.\n","   - **Analogy:** Imagine a remote control: you can only press buttons (methods) to interact with it, without seeing how it works internally (data).\n","   - **Example:**\n","     ```python\n","     class Car:\n","         def __init__(self, make, model):\n","             self.__make = make  # Private attribute\n","             self.__model = model\n","\n","         def get_car_info(self):\n","             return f\"{self.__make} - {self.__model}\"\n","     ```\n","\n","2. **Abstraction**\n","   - **Definition:** Abstraction hides complex implementation details and only exposes essential features.\n","   - **Purpose:** It reduces complexity and allows users to interact with a simplified interface.\n","   - **Analogy:** Think of driving a car: you don’t need to know how the engine works to drive it.\n","   - **Example:**\n","     ```python\n","     class CoffeeMachine:\n","         def make_coffee(self):\n","             self.__heat_water()\n","             self.__grind_beans()\n","             return \"Your coffee is ready!\"\n","     ```\n","\n","3. **Inheritance**\n","   - **Definition:** Inheritance allows one class (child class) to acquire properties and behaviors from another class (parent class).\n","   - **Purpose:** It promotes code reuse and creates a hierarchical relationship between classes.\n","   - **Analogy:** A child inheriting traits from their parents—like eye color or height—is similar to how a class inherits attributes from its parent.\n","   - **Example:**\n","     ```python\n","     class Animal:\n","         def speak(self):\n","             return \"Animal speaks\"\n","         \n","     class Dog(Animal):\n","         def speak(self):\n","             return \"Dog barks\"\n","     ```\n","\n","4. **Polymorphism**\n","   - **Definition:** Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to respond to the same method call in their own way.\n","   - **Purpose:** It provides flexibility in code by allowing different objects to use the same interface.\n","   - **Analogy:** Imagine the word \"play\": it could mean playing a video, playing a song, or playing a game depending on the context.\n","   - **Example:**\n","     ```python\n","     class Bird:\n","         def fly(self):\n","             return \"Flies in the sky\"\n","     \n","     class Penguin(Bird):\n","         def fly(self):\n","             return \"Can't fly but swims\"\n","     ```\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **Key Concepts in OOP**\n","\n","1. **Class and Object**\n","   - **Class:** A blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines attributes and methods.\n","   - **Object:** An instance of a class that contains actual values for the class’s attributes.\n","   - **Analogy:** A class is like a cookie cutter, and objects are the cookies made from it.\n","   - **Example:**\n","     ```python\n","     class Book:\n","         def __init__(self, title, author):\n","             self.title = title\n","             self.author = author\n","\n","     my_book = Book(\"1984\", \"George Orwell\")\n","     ```\n","\n","2. **Constructor**\n","   - **Definition:** A constructor is a special method in a class that is automatically invoked when an object is created, initializing the object’s attributes.\n","   - **Purpose:** It prepares the object for use by setting its initial state.\n","   - **Example:**\n","     ```python\n","     class Person:\n","         def __init__(self, name, age):\n","             self.name = name\n","             self.age = age\n","     ```\n","\n","3. **Method Overloading and Overriding**\n","   - **Overloading:** Allows multiple methods with the same name but different parameters.\n","   - **Overriding:** Allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation of a method already defined in its parent class.\n","   - **Example (Overriding):**\n","     ```python\n","     class Parent:\n","         def greet(self):\n","             return \"Hello from Parent\"\n","     \n","     class Child(Parent):\n","         def greet(self):\n","             return \"Hello from Child\"\n","     ```\n","\n","4. **Access Modifiers**\n","   - **Public:** Accessible from anywhere.\n","   - **Private:** Accessible only within the class.\n","   - **Protected:** Accessible within the class and its subclasses.\n","   - **Purpose:** Controls how much access other parts of the program have to the data and methods within a class.\n","   - **Example:**\n","     ```python\n","     class Employee:\n","         def __init__(self, name, salary):\n","             self.name = name  # Public attribute\n","             self.__salary = salary  # Private attribute\n","     ```\n","\n","5. **Static Methods**\n","   - **Definition:** Methods that belong to the class itself rather than any object instance.\n","   - **Purpose:** Used for functionality related to the class rather than any individual object.\n","   - **Example:**\n","     ```python\n","     class MathOperations:\n","         @staticmethod\n","         def add(a, b):\n","             return a + b\n","     ```\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **Questions to Reinforce Learning**\n","\n","1. What is the difference between encapsulation and abstraction?\n","2. How does inheritance enhance code reusability?\n","3. Why is polymorphism important for flexibility in OOP?\n","4. Can you give an example of method overriding in Python?\n","5. How do constructors help in object creation?\n","6. What is the purpose of access modifiers in a class?\n","7. When would you use static methods in Python?\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **Summary of Object-Oriented Programming**\n","\n","Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) structures programs around objects rather than functions or logic. Key principles include **Encapsulation**, which hides an object's data; **Abstraction**, which simplifies interactions by hiding complexity; **Inheritance**, which promotes reusability; and **Polymorphism**, which enhances flexibility by allowing objects to share behaviors. A **class** is a blueprint, while an **object** is an instance of that class. Concepts like **constructors** help initialize objects, **method overriding** allows customized behavior in subclasses, and **static methods** are class-level methods. Understanding OOP enables better code structure, maintainability, and scalability.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### Operator Overloading in Python\n","Operator overloading is a feature in Python that allows operators (like `+`, `-`, `*`, etc.) to have different meanings based on the type of objects they operate on. This allows custom behavior to be defined for Python’s built-in operators when they are used with user-defined objects, making code more intuitive and readable.\n","\n","### Relation to Polymorphism\n","Yes, operator overloading is related to polymorphism. Through operator overloading, we allow operators to work in different ways depending on the type of the operands, thus enabling a form of polymorphism. The same operator can exhibit different behaviors based on the context, just like polymorphic functions can act differently based on the input type.\n","\n","### Achieving Operator Overloading\n","In Python, operator overloading is achieved by defining special methods, also known as **magic methods** or **dunder methods** (short for \"double underscore\" methods), within a class. These methods are called automatically when the corresponding operator is used with an object of that class.\n","\n","### Magic Methods in Python\n","Magic methods start and end with double underscores (`__`). Python provides a set of magic methods for each operator, which allow you to customize the behavior of these operators for your class.\n","\n","### List of Common Magic Methods with Examples\n","\n","1. **Arithmetic Operators**\n","    - `__add__(self, other)` for `+`\n","    - `__sub__(self, other)` for `-`\n","    - `__mul__(self, other)` for `*`\n","    - `__truediv__(self, other)` for `/`\n","    - `__floordiv__(self, other)` for `//`\n","    - `__mod__(self, other)` for `%`\n","    - `__pow__(self, other)` for `**`\n","\n","    ```python\n","    class Vector:\n","        def __init__(self, x, y):\n","            self.x = x\n","            self.y = y\n","        \n","        def __add__(self, other):\n","            return Vector(self.x + other.x, self.y + other.y)\n","\n","        def __sub__(self, other):\n","            return Vector(self.x - other.x, self.y - other.y)\n","\n","        def __repr__(self):\n","            return f\"Vector({self.x}, {self.y})\"\n","    \n","    v1 = Vector(2, 3)\n","    v2 = Vector(4, 5)\n","    print(v1 + v2)  # Vector(6, 8)\n","    print(v1 - v2)  # Vector(-2, -2)\n","    ```\n","\n","2. **Comparison Operators**\n","    - `__eq__(self, other)` for `==`\n","    - `__ne__(self, other)` for `!=`\n","    - `__lt__(self, other)` for `<`\n","    - `__le__(self, other)` for `<=`\n","    - `__gt__(self, other)` for `>`\n","    - `__ge__(self, other)` for `>=`\n","\n","    ```python\n","    class Book:\n","        def __init__(self, title, pages):\n","            self.title = title\n","            self.pages = pages\n","\n","        def __lt__(self, other):\n","            return self.pages < other.pages\n","\n","        def __eq__(self, other):\n","            return self.pages == other.pages\n","\n","    book1 = Book(\"Book One\", 300)\n","    book2 = Book(\"Book Two\", 450)\n","    print(book1 < book2)  # True\n","    print(book1 == book2) # False\n","    ```\n","\n","3. **Unary Operators**\n","    - `__neg__(self)` for `-` (unary negation)\n","    - `__pos__(self)` for `+` (unary plus)\n","    - `__abs__(self)` for `abs()`\n","\n","    ```python\n","    class Temperature:\n","        def __init__(self, celsius):\n","            self.celsius = celsius\n","\n","        def __neg__(self):\n","            return Temperature(-self.celsius)\n","\n","        def __abs__(self):\n","            return Temperature(abs(self.celsius))\n","\n","        def __repr__(self):\n","            return f\"Temperature({self.celsius}°C)\"\n","\n","    temp = Temperature(25)\n","    print(-temp)  # Temperature(-25°C)\n","    print(abs(temp))  # Temperature(25°C)\n","    ```\n","\n","4. **String Representation Methods**\n","    - `__str__(self)` for `str()` or `print()`\n","    - `__repr__(self)` for `repr()` or debugging output\n","\n","    ```python\n","    class Person:\n","        def __init__(self, name, age):\n","            self.name = name\n","            self.age = age\n","\n","        def __str__(self):\n","            return f\"{self.name}, age {self.age}\"\n","\n","        def __repr__(self):\n","            return f\"Person(name='{self.name}', age={self.age})\"\n","\n","    p = Person(\"Alice\", 30)\n","    print(str(p))  # Alice, age 30\n","    print(repr(p)) # Person(name='Alice', age=30)\n","    ```\n","\n","5. **Container/Sequence Protocol**\n","    - `__len__(self)` for `len()`\n","    - `__getitem__(self, index)` for indexing `[]`\n","    - `__setitem__(self, index, value)` for setting with indexing `[]`\n","    - `__delitem__(self, index)` for deletion with `del`\n","\n","    ```python\n","    class MyList:\n","        def __init__(self, *values):\n","            self.data = list(values)\n","\n","        def __len__(self):\n","            return len(self.data)\n","\n","        def __getitem__(self, index):\n","            return self.data[index]\n","\n","        def __setitem__(self, index, value):\n","            self.data[index] = value\n","\n","        def __repr__(self):\n","            return str(self.data)\n","\n","    my_list = MyList(1, 2, 3)\n","    print(len(my_list))     # 3\n","    print(my_list[1])       # 2\n","    my_list[1] = 99\n","    print(my_list)          # [1, 99, 3]\n","    ```\n","\n","### Advantages of Operator Overloading\n","1. **Readable and Intuitive Code:** Using operators makes the code cleaner and more intuitive.\n","2. **Object Interactions:** Overloaded operators allow objects to interact naturally, just like built-in data types.\n","3. **Flexibility in Design:** Operator overloading enables customization of built-in behavior to fit custom types, enhancing the object-oriented design.\n","\n","\n","The `super()` method in Python is a built-in function used to call methods from a parent or superclass in a child or subclass. It is especially useful in scenarios involving inheritance, allowing a child class to access and extend the functionality of its parent class without directly naming the parent class. This makes code more flexible and easier to maintain.\n","\n","### Key Points about `super()`\n","\n","1. **Calls the Parent Class Method**: `super()` allows you to call a method in the parent class from the child class.\n","2. **Works with Multiple Inheritance**: `super()` follows the Method Resolution Order (MRO), ensuring that methods are called in the correct order even with multiple inheritance.\n","3. **Avoids Hardcoding the Parent Class Name**: By using `super()`, you don’t need to hardcode the parent class name, making it easier to change the inheritance structure if needed.\n","\n","### Basic Usage of `super()`\n","\n","Let’s start with a simple example of `super()` in single inheritance:\n","\n","```python\n","class Animal:\n","    def __init__(self, name):\n","        self.name = name\n","\n","    def speak(self):\n","        print(f\"{self.name} makes a sound\")\n","\n","class Dog(Animal):\n","    def __init__(self, name, breed):\n","        super().__init__(name)  # Calls Animal's __init__ method\n","        self.breed = breed\n","\n","    def speak(self):\n","        super().speak()  # Calls Animal's speak method\n","        print(f\"{self.name} barks\")  # Extends functionality\n","```\n","\n","In this example:\n","- `Dog` inherits from `Animal`.\n","- `Dog.__init__` calls `super().__init__(name)` to initialize the `name` attribute in `Animal`, allowing `Dog` to add additional attributes (like `breed`) without rewriting the `Animal` initialization.\n","- `Dog.speak()` uses `super().speak()` to call `Animal.speak()` before adding extra behavior (printing `\"{self.name} barks\"`).\n","\n","### How `super()` Works with Multiple Inheritance\n","\n","In a multiple inheritance scenario, `super()` calls follow the MRO order, ensuring each class in the inheritance chain is called in the correct order. Here’s an example:\n","\n","```python\n","class A:\n","    def process(self):\n","        print(\"A.process\")\n","\n","class B(A):\n","    def process(self):\n","        super().process()  # Calls A.process\n","        print(\"B.process\")\n","\n","class C(A):\n","    def process(self):\n","        super().process()  # Calls A.process\n","        print(\"C.process\")\n","\n","class D(B, C):  # Multiple inheritance\n","    def process(self):\n","        super().process()  # Calls B.process following MRO\n","        print(\"D.process\")\n","\n","d = D()\n","d.process()\n","```\n","\n","The output will be:\n","```plaintext\n","A.process\n","C.process\n","B.process\n","D.process\n","```\n","\n","**Explanation**:\n","- `D.process` calls `super().process()`, which first checks `B.process` (according to the MRO).\n","- `B.process` calls `super().process()`, which goes to `C.process`.\n","- `C.process` calls `super().process()`, which finally calls `A.process`.\n","\n","### Summary\n","- `super()` is used to call parent class methods and constructors.\n","- It supports single and multiple inheritance, following the MRO.\n","- It helps avoid repeating code by reusing parent class functionality."],"metadata":{"id":"f-gFuXtShRqw"}}]}
