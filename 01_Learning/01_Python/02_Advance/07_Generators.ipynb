Think of them as a recipe that gives you one step at a time, only when you ask for it.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **How Do Generators Work?**\n","- **Define a generator** with a function using the `yield` keyword.\n","- Each time you call the generator, it **\"remembers\"** where it left off and gives you the next item.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **Simple Example**\n","\n","Here’s a generator that counts up to a number:\n","\n","```python\n","def count_up_to(n):\n","    count = 1\n","    while count <= n:\n","        yield count  # Send back the current number\n","        count += 1   # Move to the next number\n","```\n","\n","**Using it:**\n","\n","```python\n","for num in count_up_to(3):\n","    print(num)  # Output: 1, 2, 3\n","```\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **Why Use Generators?**\n","1. **Saves Memory**: Only one item is in memory at a time.\n","2. **Lazy**: It gives you values only when you ask, so it's faster for big sequences.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **Generator Shortcut**\n","- You can make a generator with a quick expression like this:\n","\n","  ```python\n","  squares = (x * x for x in range(5))\n","  ```\n","\n","  This creates a generator that squares numbers.\n","\n","---\n","\n","**Bottom Line:** Generators give you one item at a time. They’re great for handling big data without using lots of memory.\n","\n","\n","\n","### **Questions**:\n","1. What are the main advantages of using generators over lists in Python?\n","2. How does the `yield` keyword change the behavior of a function compared to `return`?\n","3. Can you provide a real-world example where using a generator would be more beneficial than using a list?\n","\n","---"],"metadata":{"id":"T067TTAoqDC7"}}]}
